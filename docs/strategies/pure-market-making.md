## üìù Summary

This strategy allows Hummingbot users to run a market making strategy on a single trading pair on a `spot` exchanges.

It places limit buy (bid) and limit sell (ask) orders on the order book at prices relative to the mid-price with spreads equal to `bid_spread` and `ask_spread`. Every `order_refresh_time` seconds, the strategy replaces existing orders with new orders with refreshed spreads and order amounts.

In addition, the strategy contains a number of parameters to enable traders to control how orders are placed relative to their inventory position, use prices from a different order book, etc.

## üìì Description

[Trading logic](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/strategy/pure_market_making/pure_market_making.pyx)

!!! note "Approximation only"
    The description below is a general approximation of this strategy. Please inspect the strategy code in **Trading Logic** above to understand exactly how it works.

### Architecture

The built-in pure market making strategy in Hummingbot periodically requests limit order proposals from configurable order pricing and sizing plugins, and also periodically refreshes the orders by cancelling existing limit orders.

Here's a high level view of the logic flow inside the built-in pure market making strategy.

![Figure 5: Pure market making strategy logical flowchart](/assets/img/pure-mm-flowchart.svg)

The pure market making strategy operates in a tick-by-tick manner. Each tick is typically 1 second, although it can be programmatically modified to longer or shorter durations.

At each tick, the pure market making strategy would first query the order filter plugin whether to proceed or not. Assuming the answer is yes, then it'll query the order pricing and sizing plugins and calculate whether and what market making orders it should emit. At the same time, it'll also look at any existing limit orders it previously placed on the market and decide whether it should cancel those.

The process repeats over and over at each tick, causing limit orders to be periodically placed and cancelled according to the proposals made by the order pricing and sizing plugins.

### Refreshing Orders

For each limit order that was emitted by the pure market making strategy, an expiry timestamp would be generated for that order and the order will be tracked by the strategy. The time until expiry for new orders is configured via the `order_refresh_time` parameter.

After an order's expiration time is reached, the pure market making strategy will create a cancel order proposal for that order.

### Executing Order Proposals

After collecting all the order pricing, sizing and cancel order proposals from plugins and the internal refresh order logic - the pure market making strategy logic will merge all of the proposals and execute them.

### Example Order Flow

Below is a hypothetical example of how the pure market making strategy works for a few clock ticks.

* At clock tick `t`, there may be existing limit orders on both the bid and ask sides, and both have not yet expired. The proposed sizes for new orders will be 0, and there will be no cancel order proposals. So the strategy will do nothing for this clock tick.
* At clock tick `t+1`, the limit bid order has expired. The strategy will then generate a cancel order proposal for the expired bid order. The cancellation will then be send to the exchange and executed.
* At clock tick `t+2`, the strategy loops through its trading logic and notices there's no longer an order at the bid side. So it'll propose a non-zero order size for a new bid order. Let's assume the existing ask order hasn't expired yet, so no cancellation proposals will be generated at this clock tick. At the execution phase, the strategy will simply create a bid order calculated from the current market mid-price. Thus the bid order is refreshed.

This cycle of order creation and order cancellation will repeat again and again for as long as the strategy is running. If a limit order is completely filled by a market order, the strategy will simply refresh it at the next clock tick.
