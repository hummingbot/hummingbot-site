Community strategies have passed the Minimum Voting Power Threshold in the latest Poll and are included in each monthly release. They are not maintained by Hummingbot Foundation but may be maintained by a community member.

## üìù Summary

This strategy allows market making across multiple pairs on an exchange on a single Hummingbot instance. This is achieved by enabling users to configure the markets they would like to participate in and other market-making configurations. Volatility-Spread adjustment is another key feature of this strategy, where the spreads are dynamically adjusted based on the volatility of the markets.

## üè¶ Exchanges supported
