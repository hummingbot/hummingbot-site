## Create a Miner account

Miner is a liquidity mining platform where you can run market making bots to earn liquidity rewards on various exchanges. In this step, you will add your read-only API key to Miner so that you can earn and monitor rewards for the orders placed by your bots.

> Users are free to download and run Hummingbot without signing up on the mining platform. The liquidity mining strategy in particular, however, is optimized for participating in Miner campaigns.

1. Navigate to [Miner](https://miner.hummingbot.io), and click on `Log in`
