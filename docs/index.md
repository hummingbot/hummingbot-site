# Hummingbot Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for Hummingbot!

Hummingbot is an open source framework that helps you build **crypto trading bots** that run on both centralized exchanges (CEX), as well as decentralized exchanges (DEX) on various blockchain networks. Our codebase is free and publicly available on Github under the Apache 2.0 open source license.

Help us **democratize high-frequency trading** and provide free access to sophisticated algorithms and tooling to everyone!!

## 👩‍💻 Hummingbot components

Hummingbot architecture features modular components that can be maintained and extended by individual community members:
