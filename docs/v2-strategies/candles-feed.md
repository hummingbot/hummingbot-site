The Candles Feed component, introduced in version [1.13.0](/release-notes/1.13.0/#custom-ohlcv-candles), helps users to generate custom OHLCV candles using both historical and live Websocket data, allowing traders to create real-time custom technical indicators using [pandas_ta](https://github.com/twopirllc/pandas-ta) that can be used in a variety of ways.

You will likely want to add technical indicators to the candle data, and we recommend using [pandas_ta](https://github.com/twopirllc/pandas-ta).

## Description

The [`CandlesBase`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/data_feed/candles_feed/candles_base.py) class is a subclass of [`NetworkBase`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/core/network_base.py) and serves as a base class for fetching and storing candle data from a cryptocurrency exchange.

This class provides a common interface and uses Rest and WS Assistants for all IO operations, along with a double-ended queue to store candles. Additionally, it implements the Throttler module for API rate limiting, although it's not necessary since real-time data should primarily be updated via WebSockets.

## Data sources

All the data sources for candles inherit CandlesBase to implement the specific endpoints. As of version 1.18.0, here are the available sources:

### Spot

- `binance`: See [`BinanceSpotCandles`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/tree/master/hummingbot/data_feed/candles_feed/binance_spot_candles) for the implementation.
- `kucoin`
- `gate_io`
- `ascendex`

### Perp
- `binance_perpetual`: See [`BinancePerpetualCandles`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/tree/master/hummingbot/data_feed/candles_feed/binance_perpetual_candles) for the implementation.
- `kucoin_perpetual`
- `gate_io_perpetual`

To create a new instance of this component, it is recommended to use the `get_candle` method of the `CandlesFactory` (which will be demonstrated later in an example).

## Relevant scripts

 You can find examples of usage in the following scripts:

- [candles_example](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/archived_scripts/examples_using_data_feeds/candles_example.py)
- [simple_directional_strategy_example](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/archived_scripts/examples_using_smart_components/directional_strategy_rsi_spot.py)
- [advanced_directional_strategy_example](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/archived_scripts/examples_using_smart_components/directional_strategy_trend_follower.py)

You can also initialize as many candles as you need. For each combination of `[connector_name, trading_pair, interval]`, you should create a new instance using the `CandlesFactory`.

## Key methods and properties

- `CandlesFactory.get_candle(connector_name: str, trading_pair: str, interval:str = "1m", max_records:int = 500)`
    - `connector_name`: name of the data source, e.g. [`binance`, `binance_perpetual`]
    - `trading_pair`: hb_trading_pair, e.g. `BASE-QUOTE`
    - `interval`: time interval between candles (check the intervals available for each source)
    - `max_records`: the maximum size of the dequeue that will store the candles. When the component starts, it will collect the first WebSocket message and create a task to fill the dequeue via REST while the WebSocket messages continue arriving

- `start()`: it is essential to start this component after initialization as it will begin streaming and collecting the candles. It is recommended to call this method in the `init` of the strategy. An example will be provided later.

- `stop()`: it is necessary to stop the candle when the strategy or script ends. For scripts, it is recommended to use the `on_stop()` method of `ScriptStrategyBase` since it allows you to execute code when you call the stop command.

- `is_ready`: this boolean property checks if the quantity of collected candles is equal to the maximum records needed.

- `candles_df`: this property returns a DataFrame with the most updated information of the candles. Binance sends updates every second, so you will have all this information available in real-time: `["timestamp", "open", "high", "low", "close", "volume", "quote_asset_volume", "n_trades", "taker_buy_base_volume", "taker_buy_quote_volume"]`

If you want to see it in action, run the [candles_example.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/candles_example.py) script and use the command `status --live` to see the candles in real-time.

[![alt text](candles-a.jpg)](candles-a.jpg)

Remember that you need to create an instance for each candle you want to use, start and stop them, and access information by using the `candles_df` property only when the candle `is_ready` property is True.

Also, it's best to access candle information when it's full because `max_records` should be determined based on the maximum number of records needed to compute technical indicators. For example, if the largest indicator is a moving average of the last 400 periods, then `max_records` should be greater than 400.

## Code samples

The following code examples demonstrate how to use candles in Hummingbot to gather historical data and use it to inform trades.

### Initializing candles

This fetches a single candle of `BTC-USDT` of `BinanceSpot`:

```python
from typing import Dict

from hummingbot.connector.connector_base import ConnectorBase

from hummingbot.data_feed.candles_feed.candles_factory import CandlesFactory
from hummingbot.strategy.script_strategy_base import ScriptStrategyBase


class InitializingCandlesExample(ScriptStrategyBase):
    candles = CandlesFactory.get_candle("binance", "BTC-USDT", "3m")

    markets = {"kucoin_paper_trade": {"BTC-USDT"}}

    def __init__(self, connectors: Dict[str, ConnectorBase]):
        # Is necessary to start the Candles Feed.
        super().__init__(connectors)
        self.candles.start()

    def on_stop(self):
        self.candles.stop()
```

Note that the candles are independent from the Hummingbot connector that is used to trade. In this example it shows how to initialize a single candle for a specific trading pair, using `Binance` candles to trade on `KuCoin`. This opens up a lot of possibilities like, trading in an illiquid market with information of a liquid one, or use information of perpetuals and spot candles to trade in another market.

If you run the code example above in Hummingbot you won't see any output but in the next example we can see how we can output the data every tick

### Logging candles every tick

To log the dataframe of the candles every tick, you can use the `on_tick` method by adding this code:

```python
def on_tick(self):
    self.logger().info(self.candles.candles_df)
```

Our script should now look like this:

```python hl_lines="22 23"
from typing import Dict

from hummingbot.connector.connector_base import ConnectorBase

from hummingbot.data_feed.candles_feed.candles_factory import CandlesFactory
from hummingbot.strategy.script_strategy_base import ScriptStrategyBase


class InitializingCandlesExample(ScriptStrategyBase):
    candles = CandlesFactory.get_candle("binance", "BTC-USDT", "3m")

    markets = {"kucoin_paper_trade": {"BTC-USDT"}}

    def __init__(self, connectors: Dict[str, ConnectorBase]):
        # Is necessary to start the Candles Feed.
        super().__init__(connectors)
        self.candles.start()

    def on_stop(self):
        self.candles.stop()

  def on_tick(self):
    self.logger().info(self.candles.candles_df)
```

Note that this may not be a good idea because you are going to have a lot of logs, but this shows you how to access the information of the candles every tick.

If you want to see how to show the candles in the `format_status` method, check the script [candles_example](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/candles_example.py) of the codebase or the screenshot posted above.

In the screenshot below we can see the output in the log pane which is updated every tick:

### Multiple candles

```python
from typing import Dict

from hummingbot.connector.connector_base import ConnectorBase

from hummingbot.data_feed.candles_feed.candles_factory import CandlesFactory
from hummingbot.strategy.script_strategy_base import ScriptStrategyBase


class InitializingCandlesExample(ScriptStrategyBase):
    candles_1 = CandlesFactory.get_candle("binance", "BTC-USDT", "3m")
    candles_3 = CandlesFactory.get_candle("binance", "BTC-USDT", "1m")
    candles_2 = CandlesFactory.get_candle("binance_perpetual", "ETH-USDT", "1m")

    markets = {"kucoin_paper_trade": {"BTC-USDT"}}

    def __init__(self, connectors: Dict[str, ConnectorBase]):
        # Is necessary to start the Candles Feed.
        super().__init__(connectors)
        self.candles_1.start()
        self.candles_2.start()
        self.candles_3.start()

    def on_stop(self):
        self.candles_1.stop()
        self.candles_2.stop()
        self.candles_3.stop()
```

This code example shows how to initialize multiple candles for different trading pairs, intervals, and connectors. The `CandlesFactory` class is used again to create multiple instances of candles, which can be started and stopped using the `start` and `stop` methods. By storing the candles in a dictionary, it's possible to create strategies combining indicators of different sources. The [directional_strategy_bb_rsi_multi_timeframe](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/directional_strategy_bb_rsi_multi_timeframe.py) script in the codebase demonstrates how to do this.

### Downloading historical data

You can also use Hummingbot to download historical candles. To do so, check out the [download_candles](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/download_candles.py) example that shows how to collect all the candles selected and store them in a CSV inside the data folder.
