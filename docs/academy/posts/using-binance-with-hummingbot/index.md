## Generate API Keys

**Step 1**

Log in to your Binance account and click **Profile** - **[API Management](https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management)**

**Step 2**

Click **Create API**. Please note that before creating an API Key, you need to:

   - Enable [two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/account-functions?c=1&navId=1#11) on your account.
   - Make a deposit of any amount to activate your account.

Select **System generated** as your preferred API Key type. For more details on self-generated API Keys, please refer to [How to Generate an RSA Key Pair to Send API Requests on Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/2b79728f331e43079b27440d9d15c5db).

Your API Key is now created. Do not disclose your API Key, Secret Key (HMAC), or Private Key (RSA) to anyone to avoid asset losses. If you forget your Secret Key, you'll need to delete the API and create a new one.

## Add Keys to Hummingbot

From inside the Hummingbot client, run `connect binance`:

```
>>> connect binance

Enter your binance API key >>>
Enter your binance secret key >>>
```

If connection is successful:

```
You are now connected to binance
```
