# Hummingbot MCP Server

The Hummingbot Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server enables AI assistants like Claude and Gemini to interact with Hummingbot for automated cryptocurrency trading across multiple exchanges.

**GitHub Repository**: [github.com/hummingbot/mcp](https://github.com/hummingbot/mcp)

## Overview

The MCP Server acts as a bridge between AI language models and the Hummingbot trading platform, enabling programmatic interaction with cryptocurrency trading infrastructure. This allows AI assistants to manage trading operations, analyze portfolios, and execute strategies on behalf of users.

## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely interact with external systems and data sources. In the context of Hummingbot, MCP allows AI models to:

- Access real-time trading data
- Execute trading operations
- Manage portfolios across multiple exchanges
- Analyze market conditions
- Monitor trading performance

## Getting Started

Ready to build AI trading agents with Hummingbot? Follow these steps:

1. **[Install the MCP Server](/mcp/installation/)** - Set up development or production environment
2. **[Explore Available Tools](/mcp/tools/)** - Learn about trading and portfolio management capabilities  
3. **Configure your AI assistant** - Connect Claude, Gemini, or other MCP-compatible AI
4. **Start trading conversations** - Let AI manage your portfolio automatically

## Quick Overview

The MCP server provides comprehensive trading capabilities through these tool categories:

### üè¶ **Account & Portfolio Management**
Monitor balances, track performance, and analyze portfolio allocation across all connected exchanges.

### üìä **Order & Position Management** 
Execute trades, manage orders, and control positions programmatically with AI oversight.

### üìà **Market Data & Analysis**
Access real-time prices, funding rates, and order book data for informed decision making.

## Usage with AI Assistants

### Claude CLI

1. **Install Claude CLI** following [Anthropic's guide](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-cli)

2. **Configure MCP server** in your Claude configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hummingbot": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "mcp"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/hummingbot-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Start trading conversation**:
```
You: Show me my portfolio balances across all exchanges
Claude: I'll check your portfolio balances using the Hummingbot MCP server...
```

### Gemini CLI

The configuration process for Gemini CLI - refer to Google's documentation for MCP setup or check out [Gemini CLI Installation](/mcp/installation/#gemini-cli) 

## Example Workflows

### Portfolio Analysis
```
AI: "What's my current portfolio worth and how is it distributed?"
MCP: Retrieves balances across all exchanges and calculates total value
AI: Provides detailed breakdown with recommendations
```

### Automated Trading
```
AI: "Buy 0.1 BTC when the price drops below $45,000"
MCP: Monitors prices and executes order when conditions are met
AI: Confirms execution and provides trade summary
```

### Risk Management
```
AI: "Close all positions with unrealized losses over 5%"
MCP: Analyzes open positions and closes those meeting criteria  
AI: Reports actions taken and updated portfolio status
```

### OpenAI Codex

See [Codex CLI Installation](/mcp/installation/#codex-cli) for setup.

## Security Considerations

- **API Credentials**: Store credentials securely and never commit them to version control
- **Network Access**: Ensure MCP server can only be accessed by authorized AI assistants
- **Trading Limits**: Set appropriate position sizes and risk limits in your strategies
- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor AI trading activity and set up alerts for unusual behavior
