!!! tip
    Use the [development](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/tree/development), since Gateway is still new and undergoing active work. Once you have cloned the Hummingbot repo, you can run `git checkout development` to switch to that branch.


For developers, we recommend installing Hummingbot from source, rather than Docker. This allows you to run Gateway as a standalone server and connect to it from the Hummingbot client. This setup has a few advantages:
* Makes upgrading to new versions of Hummingbot/Gateway easier
* Easier access to configuration files
* Enables multiple client instances to connect to one Gateway instance

First, follow [these instructions](/installation/source/) to install Hummingbot from source on MacOS, Windows, or Linux-based systems. Then, follow the steps below to start a Gateway server and enable the Hummingbot client to communicate with it.

## Generate certs

## Set up Gateway SSL

## Run Gateway server

## Connect Hummingbot client

## Dependencies

### Linux

Run the following commands to install node and other dependencies. The example illustrates a Debian-based Linux Distro.

```bash
# Installing curl
sudo apt install curl

# Installing jq
sudo apt install jq

# Installs nodejs v14.x
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Installs Yarn
curl -sL https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install yarn

```

### MacOS

If you’re using `homebrew` execute the following command to install `node` and other dependencies.

```bash
# Using Homebrew installs node and yarn
brew install node
brew install yarn

# Installing curl
brew install curl

# Installing jq. Note: jq is like `sed` for JSON data
brew install jq

# Installing envsubst
brew install gettext
brew link --force gettext

```

## Generating Configurations and SSL Certificates

There are bash scripts in `$PROJECT_HOME/gateway/setup` folder that can be used to generate the necessary configurations and certificates that will be used by both the Gateway Server and the Hummingbot Client.

- **Generate Certificates using Hummingbot Client**
  - Run the Hummingbot client.
  - Run the `gateway generate-certs` command
  - The passphrase must be the same as the hummingbot client password
  - Take note of the directory in which the certs are being created. It will be used to configure ssl certifacte.
        ![Generate Certs](/assets/img/generate-certs.png)
- **Generating the configuration**
    Execute the following commands:

    ```bash
    cd $PROJECT_HOME/gateway/setup

    # Generates and configures the ethereum.yml conf to use the right Infura Eth node
    ./generate_conf.sh $GATEWAY_CONF_FOLDER $INFURA_PROJECT_ID

    # $GATEWAY_CONF_FOLDER - Directory the ssl.yml file is located in
    # $CA_CERT_FILE_PATH - Intended value for the caCertificatePath configuration.
    # $CERT_FILE_PATH - Intended value for the certificatePath configuration.
    # KEY_FILE_PATH - Intended value for the keyPath configuration.
    ./generate_ssl_conf.sh -f $GATEWAY_CONF_FOLDER -c $GATEWAY_CA_FILE -e $GATEWAY_SERVER_CERT_FILE -k $GATEWAY_SERVER_KEY_FILE

    ```

    **Note:**

    1. `$GATEWAY_CONF_FOLDER` should be the `$PROJECT_HOME/gateway/conf` folder.

    2. For `INFURA_PROJECT_ID`, you can register for a free infura account and create your own Ethereum node for testing.

    3. The files passed to `GATEWAY_CA_FILE`, `GATEWAY_SERVER_CERT_FILE`, and `GATEWAY_SERVER_KEY_FILE` are generated by `create_certs.sh` and should be under `$PROJECT_HOME/gateway/certs`.

- **List of Environment Variables**

    Below is an example of environment variables that are used by the aforementioned scripts and within the Hummingbot Client

    ```bash
    # Used within Hummingbot client to initialize GatewayHttpClient
    export GATEWAY_CONF_FOLDER="/Users/<username>/hummingbot/gateway/conf"
    export CERT_FOLDER="/Users/<username>/.hummingbot-gateway/hummingbot-gateway-36191c46/certs"
    export GATEWAY_LOGS_FOLDER="/Users/<username>/.hummingbot-gateway/hummingbot-gateway-36191c46/logs"

    # Used to populate the Gateway conf accordingly
    export INFURA_PROJECT_ID="<INFURA PROJECT ID>"
    export GATEWAY_CA_FILE="/Users/<username>/.hummingbot-gateway/hummingbot-gateway-36191c46/certs/ca_cert.pem"
    export GATEWAY_SERVER_CERT_FILE="/Users/<username>/.hummingbot-gateway/hummingbot-gateway-36191c46/certs/server_cert.pem"
    export GATEWAY_SERVER_KEY_FILE="/Users/<username>/.hummingbot-gateway/hummingbot-gateway-36191c46/certs/server_key.pem"


    # Used in curl commands for manual-testing
    export GATEWAY_CERT="/Users/<username>/.hummingbot-gateway/hummingbot-gateway-36191c46/certs/client_cert.pem"
    export GATEWAY_KEY="/Users/<username>/.hummingbot-gateway/hummingbot-gateway-36191c46/certs/client_key.pem"
    export ETH_ADDRESS="<ETH_ADDRESS>"

    ```

## Starting Server

Execute the following commands

```bash
# $PROJECT_HOME should be the root directory of the hummingbot project
cd $PROJECT_HOME/gateway

# Installs all dependencies defined
yarn

# Builds project
yarn build

# Starts the Gateway Server
yarn start --passphrase=$GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE
```

**NOTE:**

`$GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE` is the passphrase you set for the certificates when generating the ssl certificate. It should be the same as the hummingbot client password

## Additional Configurations/Troubleshooting

1. **Changing Gateway Port**

    In certain cases, the default port, `5000`, might already be in use. As such you might need to change the port number accordingly. To do so modify the following yaml files accordingly:

    - `$PROJECT_HOME/hummingbot/gateway/conf/server.yml`

        ```yaml
        port: <NEW_PORT_NUMBER>
        ipWhitelist: []
        unsafeDevModeWithHTTP: false
        GMTOffset: 800
        id: <ID>
        ```

    - `$PROJECT_HOME/hummingbot/conf/conf_client.yml`

        ```yaml
        ...
        
        # Gateway API Configurations
        # default host to only use localhost
        # Port need to match the final installation port for Gateway
        gateway_api_host: localhost
        gateway_api_port: '<NEW_PORT_NUMBER>'
        
        ...
        ```

        **NOTE:** The `NEW_PORT_NUMBER` in `conf_client.yml` should be in single-quotations

2. **Getting a `Error: could not detect network` error**
Ensure that the `nodeAPIKey` of `ethereum.yml` and/or `avalanche.yml` is entered correctly.
    - If using Infura Node, the `nodeAPIKey` refers to your **PROJECT ID**

## Testing using `curl`

Certain manual tests are defined in `$PROJECT_HOME/gateway/manual-tests/curl.sh` file. To run them, ensure that you have `curl` installed in your system.

Copy and paste individual commands into your terminal to execute the tests accordingly
i.e.

```bash
curl -s -X GET -k --key $GATEWAY_KEY --cert $GATEWAY_CERT [https://localhost:5000/](https://localhost:500/) | jq
```

Expected Output:

```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```
