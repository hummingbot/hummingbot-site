Before approving new connectors, the Hummingbot Foundation Qualtiy Assurance (QA) team will do test pull requests to ensure it is working as expected. Below is our test template for `spot` connectors.

Connects when a valid API key is added. <br> 2. Throws an error or warning if the API key is invalid, expired, or has other issues. <br> 3. The same API key can be used on multiple bots unless specified that can only be used in one instance at a time.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Market availability during the strategy creation         | While setting up strategy, you will be asked: <br> Enter the token trading pair you would like to trade on name-of-connector (e.g. ZRX-ETH) >>>                                | 1.

The connector should work on any of the strategies available in the client unless the connector is intended for a specific strategy. <br> 2. The connector should work both as a maker and taker exchange (spot connectors only)                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

A consistent number of orders are created except if there are multiple bots using the asset, there are hanging orders or an order is removed due to a specific parameter.                                                                  |

Gracefully rejects/cancels orders that donâ€™t pass the exchange rule. |
| Fast refresh rate                                        | 1. Create a pure market-making strategy and set a fast order refresh time with order refresh tolerance disabled <br> - to disable, `config order_refresh_tolerance -1` <br> 2. Run `status` or `status --live` command <br> 3. Crosscheck the client and exchange on open orders. <br> - If there are filled order, check trade history on exchange and `history` or `history --verbose` command on client <br> Note: Make sure to run the client on a machine with stable internet connection.
