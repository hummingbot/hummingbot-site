From inside the Hummingbot client, run `gateway connect carbonamm` in order to connect your wallet:

```
Which chain do you want carbonamm to connect to? (ethereum) >>>
Which network do you want carbonamm to connect to? (mainnet) >>>
Enter your ethereum-mainnet private key >>>>
```

If connection is successful (ethereum-mainnet):
