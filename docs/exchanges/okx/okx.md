!!! tip "Support Hummingbot"
    Hummingbot Foundation has a fee share partnership with OKX. When you use our software to trade on OKX, a custom API header tells OKX that the trade was executed using Hummingbot, so they share a portion of your fees with us, at no cost to you. To support us, create an account using our [OKX referral link](https://www.okx.com/join/1931920269) and enter that account's API keys into Hummingbot! Thanks for your support! 🙏
