## ⚙️ Install Instructions

At the moment there are some issues with dependencies and installing dydx can be a bit trickier due to some software conflicts. We've created these simple instructions to get you up and running quickly using either Docker or Source. 

### Docker

Open your `docker-compose.yml` file. This file is usually located in your Hummingbot project directory.

Update the `image` line. Find the line that starts with `image:` under the `hummingbot` service. Change it to the following, depending on whether you are trying to run the `latest` or `development` branch. 

For latest stable version:

```bash
image: hummingbot/hummingbot:latest_dydx
```

For development version:

```bash
image: hummingbot/hummingbot:development_dydx
```


### Source

After cloning the Hummingbot repo, use the `--dydx ` flag when running the `install` command

```bash
./install --dydx
```

See below for the full commands: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot.git
cd hummingbot
./install --dydx
conda activate hummingbot
./compile
```

## 🔑 How to Connect

### Generate API Keys

Create API credentials and a STARK private key using the dYdX documentation:

* [Recover Default API Credentials](https://dydxprotocol.github.io/v3-teacher/#recover-default-api-credentials)
* [Derive StarkKey](https://help.dydx.exchange/en/articles/4797307-what-is-a-stark-key)

Alternatively, you can follow these steps to get the required credentials:

1. From the dYdX exchange, right-click anywhere on your web browser, and select **Inspect** to open Developer Tools
2. Go to Application > Local Storage > <https://trade.dydx.exchange>
3. Select **STARK_KEY_PAIRS** and click the drop-down next to your wallet address to get the stark private key
4. Select **API_KEY_PAIRS** and click the drop-down next to your wallet address to get the API key, secret key, and passphrase

### Add Keys to Hummingbot

You will need the following to connect Hummingbot to `dydx_perpetual`:

* API key
* API secret key
* Passphrase
* Account number: set this value to `0`
* Stark private key

From inside the Hummingbot client, run `connect dydx_perpetual` in Hummingbot in order to connect your wallet:

```
Enter your dydx_perpetual API key >>>
Enter your dydx_perpetual secret key >>>
Enter your dydx_perpetual passphrase >>>
```
