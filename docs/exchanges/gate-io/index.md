!!! tip "Support Hummingbot"
    Hummingbot Foundation has a fee share partnership with Gate.io. When you use our software to trade on Gate.io, a custom API header tells Gate.io that the trade was executed using Hummingbot, so they share a portion of your fees with us, at no cost to you. To support us, just enter your API keys into Hummingbot and run bots! Thanks for your support! 🙏

4. Name your API keys

5. Add IP whitelist (optional)
Enable `Bind IP` and input the IP addresses, separated by a comma. You'll need to find the public IP address of the machine you are running Hummingbot 
If you don't want to whitelist your IP then select `Later` instead but the API keys you create will only be valid for 90 days.

6. Choose API v4 Key and a Classic Account type

    - [Spot/Margin Trade] -> [Read And Write] - it allows trading Spot and Margin
    - [Perpetual Contract] -> [Read And Write] - this will allow trading Futures. 
    - [Wallet ] -> [Read Only] -> this is necessary to display the balances correctly.


8. Carefully read the **Risk Reminder**, tick both paragraphs, and click **I Accept**
