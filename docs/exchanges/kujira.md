## üîë How to Connect

Create a Keplr wallet to use the supported networks below:

| Chain    | Networks             |
|----------|----------------------|
| `kujira` | `mainnet`, `testnet` |

From inside the Hummingbot client, run `gateway connect kujira` in order to connect your wallet:

In the private key field you have to put your mnemonic.

```  
Which chain do you want kujira to connect to? (kujira) >>> kujira

Which network do you want kujira to connect to? (mainnet, testnet) >>> mainnet

Do you want to continue to use node url 'None' for kujira-mainnet? (Yes/No) >>> Yes

Enter your kujira-mainnet wallet private key >>>  *****************************
***********************************

Enter your kujira account number (input 0 if unsure) >>> 0
```

If connection is successful:

```  
The kujira connector now uses wallet [pubKey] on kujira-mainnet  
```
