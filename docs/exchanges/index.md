## What Are Exchange Connectors?

Hummingbot is open source software that helps you create and deploy crypto trading bots across 50+ exchanges. The project has **14k+ GitHub stars** and **3.9k+ forks**, representing one of the most active trading bot communities.

Connectors are standardized API integrations that enable Hummingbot to communicate with different exchanges. Each connector implements a common interface for order management, balance tracking, and market data streaming, allowing strategies to work seamlessly across multiple exchanges.
