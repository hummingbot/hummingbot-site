!!! tip "Support Hummingbot"
    Hummingbot Foundation has a fee share partnership with Binance. When you use our software to trade on Binance, a custom API header tells Binance that the trade was executed using Hummingbot, so they share a portion of your fees with us, at no cost to you. To support us, create an account using our [Binance referral link](https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=FQQNNGCD) or [Binance Futures referral link](https://www.binance.com/en/futures/ref?code=hummingbot) and enter that account's API keys into Hummingbot! Thanks for your support! 🙏

## 🔑 How to Connect

### Generate API Keys

!!! note
    This section provides a step-by-step guide that helps you generate exchange API keys for use with Hummingbot. All information is sourced from the exchange website.

**Step 1**

Log in to your Binance account and click **Profile** - **[API Management](https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management)**

   ![Step 1](binance-api1.png)

**Step 2**

Click **Create API**. Please note that before creating an API Key, you need to:

   - Enable [two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/account-functions?c=1&navId=1#11) on your account.
   - Make a deposit of any amount to activate your account.

   ![Step 2](binance-api2.png)

Select **System generated** as your preferred API Key type. For more details on self-generated API Keys, please refer to [How to Generate an RSA Key Pair to Send API Requests on Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/2b79728f331e43079b27440d9d15c5db).

   ![Step 3](binance-api3.png)

Enter a label/name for your API Key.

   ![Step 4](binance-api4.png)

**Step 3**

Verify your request with 2FA devices.

   ![Step 5](binance-api5.png)

   [![Step 6](binance-api6.png)](binance-api6.png)

Your API Key is now created. Do not disclose your API Key, Secret Key (HMAC), or Private Key (RSA) to anyone to avoid asset losses. If you forget your Secret Key, you'll need to delete the API and create a new one.
