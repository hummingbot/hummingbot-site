!!! tip "Support Hummingbot"
    Hummingbot Foundation has a fee share partnership with Binance. When you use our software to trade on Binance, a custom API header tells Binance that the trade was executed using Hummingbot, so they share a portion of your fees with us, at no cost to you. To support us, create an account using our [Binance referral link](https://accounts.binance.com/register?ref=CBWO4LU6) and enter that account's API keys into Hummingbot and run bots! Thanks for your support! 🙏
