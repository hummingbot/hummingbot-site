## What is Quants Lab?

Quants Lab acts as a research and development platform for quantitative traders, enabling systematic strategy creation and testing. It bridges the gap between raw market data and executable trading strategies, providing a complete toolkit for quants and algorithmic traders.

- üîç Build custom screeners for specific trading signals or opportunities
- üß† Develop and backtest trading strategies

Under the hood, Quants Lab uses the [Hummingbot Python library](https://pypi.org/project/hummingbot/) and is designed to be compatible with other Hummingbot repos.
