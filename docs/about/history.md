Hummingbot is an open source framework for building high-frequency trading bots that run on crypto exchanges, both centralized and decentralized.

Launched in April 2019, Hummingbot pioneered a modular architecture that allowed external developers to contribute new exchange connectors and trading strategies. Hummingbot was originally built and open sourced by [CoinAlpha](https://coinalpha.com), a software startup and liquidity provider backed by Initialized Capital, Bain Capital Ventures, and other leading investors.

Read the original [Hummingbot whitepaper](/hummingbot.pdf) and the [origin story](../blog/posts/hummingbot-is-live/index.md) blog post for more details.

Later, the Hummingbot team wrote the [Liquidity Mining whitepaper](/liquidity-mining.pdf) that described an economic model for decentralized market making and subsequently [launched the Miner liquidity mining platform](../blog/posts/liquidity-mining-launch/index.md).

In December 2021, CoinAlpha spun off the Hummingbot Foundation as a new open source entity that maintains the Hummingbot Github repository and administers a decentralized, community-driven system of software development.

Today, Hummingbot is a bazaar-style open source project with many contributors and users around the world, both individual and professional.
