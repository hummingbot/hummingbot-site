### How exchange partnerships Work

When you sign up for an account using our referral links, a portion of your trading fees are rebated back to Hummingbot Foundation. Every time you use Hummingbot to submit an order, it sends an HTTP request to the API of the exchange. The exchange then identifies that the HTTP request for the order is coming from a user who is using the Hummingbot codebase, it checks for the metadata in the HTTP request for a Hummingbot identifier. If the identifier is present, the exchange knows that the order is coming from a Hummingbot user and will rebate a portion of the trading fees to us.
 
### Why should you support us?

These partnerships help sustain the Hummingbot Foundation's mission to keep our platform open source and free, while providing you with trading fee rebates at no additional cost. It's a win-win arrangement that supports both our users and the continued development of Hummingbot.
