Hummingbot Foundation's purpose is to empower Hummingbot Governance Token (HBOT) token holders to govern how the Hummingbot open source codebase evolves over time. HBOT holders can vote on [Proposals](proposals.md) that:

* Approve pull requests to the Hummingbot codebase
* Add or remove connectors from the codebase
* Allocate HBOT bounties for connector maintenance and improvements
* Re-elect the Foundation's Board of Directors each year
* Make changes to the Foundation governance system

!!! success "Governance Simplified - HGP-77 Approved"
    In January 2025, [HGP-77: Simplify Hummingbot Governance](https://snapshot.org/#/hbot.eth/proposal/0x38e97) was approved, consolidating 4 proposal types into a single **Hummingbot Governance Proposal (HGP)** type, removing quarterly polls, and streamlining the governance process. Key changes:

    - **Single proposal type**: All proposals via [hbot.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/hbot.eth) Snapshot space
    - **Unified parameters**: 200,000 HBOT minimum balance, 5,000,000 HBOT quorum
    - **Faster process**: 2-day discussion + 3-day vote (~5 days total)
    - **No more quarterly polls**: Connector management through ad-hoc proposals
    - **Streamlined Board**: Annual budget approval instead of quarterly meetings
