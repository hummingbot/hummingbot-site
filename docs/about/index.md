The Hummingbot Foundation is a not-for-profit organization established in the Cayman Islands. The Foundation’s mission is to democratize high-frequency trading by maintaining the open-source Hummingbot code repository and the HBOT governance system.

The official Foundation bylaws are located at: <https://hummingbot.org/bylaws.pdf>.

## Principles

Below are the core principles that underpin Hummingbot’s development:

* **Open Source**: The Hummingbot codebase is publicly available, auditable, and free
* **Modular**: Hummingbot modules can be independently built, used, and maintained by community members
* **Extensible**: Users can use Hummingbot to create any automated trading strategy on every exchange and blockchain
* **All Levels**: Hummingbot is designed for use by individuals and professionals alike

## Staff

The Foundation staff handles the day-to-day operations of maintaining the Hummingbot codebase and the Foundation governance system, such as:

* Reviewing and merging pull requests
* Administering monthly polls and elections
* Maintaining the Snapshot voting system
* Managing the Discord server
* Assigning and managing developer bounties
* Packaging monthly releases into Docker containers for various environments
* Maintaining and updating the Hummingbot website and documentation site

A 5-person Board of Directors provides oversight over the Foundation staff. See [Board](/governance/board) for more details.

## Governance

The primary purpose of Hummingbot Foundation is to enable a decentralized, bazaar-style model of software development for the Hummingbot codebase.

Launched in April 2019, Hummingbot began as a simple open source market making bot. Today, it has evolved into a extensible framework that lets you create custom trading strategies on any crypto exchange.
