## History

Launched in April 2019, Hummingbot began as a simple open source market making bot and became widely used used by token projects who want to own their liquidity, boutique trading firms, and individual traders to create and deploy automated trading strategies, especially related to market making.

Today, Hummingbot has evolved into a community-maintained, open source ecosystem that helps you **create, backtest, deploy, and manage a fleet of bots** running any algo trading strategy on any crypto exchange or blockchain.

See [History](/about/history) for more details.
