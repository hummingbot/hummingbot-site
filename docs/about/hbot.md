The Hummingbot Governance Token (HBOT) is a standard ERC-20 Ethereum token that lets holders to decide how the Hummingbot codebase changesthrough voting.

**The sole use case of the HBOT token is governance.** HBOT tokens empower holders to govern many aspects of the Hummingbot Foundation, such as allocating HBOT community distributions and electing Board of Directors.

**Hummingbot Foundation does not rely on the sale of HBOT tokens.** The Foundation sustains its operations through fee share partnerships and sponsorships with top crypto exchanges. The Foundation does not sell HBOT to fund its operations.

**Hummingbot Foundation will never issue more HBOT tokens.** The total supply of HBOT was fixed at genesis at 1,000,000,000 tokens. The Foundation forsees no need to issue more HBOT tokens in the future, once all of the HBOT supply has been distributed to the community.
