Chain connectors integrate a Layer 1 blockchain and their networks into [Gateway](/gateway), enabling wallet access, node RPC interactions, and other support needed by DEXs supported by Gateway. Each connector is customized for a particular blockchain's idiosyncrasies to enable this level of standardization, so they may should ideally have a maintainer, whose role is to ensure consistent performance by fixing bugs, incorporating API updates, and other ongoing work.

Here are the current chain connectors in the codebase:
