Hummingbot's bounty system lets sponsors tap into the thousands of quant traders and developers globally who run Hummingbot. Bounties offer a platform for those seeking development work on exchange connectors, strategies, bug fixes, and more to connect with skilled developers capable of building these solutions.

By sponsoring a bounty, you're making a significant contribution to the Hummingbot project, enabling important improvements and new features that will benefit the entire community!  

If you are interested in sponsoring a bounty, here's how you can get started.

## Types of Bounties

Here are various types of bounties that you can sponsor:

* üêû **Bug Fix**: Fix to a bug in the Hummingbot codebase
* üöÄ **Enhancement**: Update or improvement to a component in the Hummingbot codebase
* üì∫ **Content**: Documentation, videos, guides, and other content that explains how to use an aspect of Hummingbot
* üî¨ **Research**: Investigation into possible work and recommendation on how to proceed
* üè¶ **New Connector**: A new Hummingbot [connector](/exchanges/). May be public and included in official releases (requires proposal) or delivered as private fork.
* üìà **New Strategy/Script**: A new Hummingbot [strategy](/strategies/) or [script](/scripts/). May be public or private fork.

## Getting Started

Typically, bounty sponsors include:

* **Exchanges** who want Hummingbot connectors built and updated, bugs fixed, or content created
* **DEXs and blockchain protocols** who want to build Hummingbot connectors and content related to it
* **Individual traders or trading firms** who want private Hummingbot connectors or strategies

There are two paths that bounty sponsors can take:

* **Post a Bounty**: Post a single bounty on [Bounties Board](https://github.com/orgs/hummingbot/projects/7) and let us handle the rest, from assigning a dev to testing and delivering the code. To get started, identify or create a Github issue, and fill out the following form:

## Handling Fee

Hummingbot Foundation charges Sponsors a Handling Fee for overseeing the entire lifecycle of a bounty: scoping the bounty, finding and assigning the bounty to a qualified contributor, performing engineering/QA review, and conducting payments. This saves you a lot of time and effort.

The standard Handling Fee is **20%**. If a Sponsor submits a 1000 USDT total bounty, the Handling Fee is 200 USDT and the Contributor receives 800 USDT.

If the bounty is denominated in [HBOT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xe5097d9baeafb89f9bcb78c9290d545db5f9e9cb), the Handling Fee is **10%**. If a Sponsor submits a 100,000 HBOT total bounty, the Handling Fee is 10,000 HBOT and the Contributor receives 90,000 HBOT.

## Foundation Bounty Wallets

In order to fund the bounty, the Sponsor should send the total bounty amount to a designated Foundation wallet:

* **Ethereum:** [0x60D581aEa0644e74df60c7555e5166d32665d6b6](https://etherscan.io/address/0x60d581aea0644e74df60c7555e5166d32665d6b6)  
* **Binance Smart Chain:** [0xE517b826a26B439eCE92f3220628eC007049d915](https://bscscan.com/address/0xe517b826a26b439ece92f3220628c007049d915)

Since HBOT is an Ethereum ERC-20 token, all HBOT bountiy amounts must be sent to the Ethereum wallet.
