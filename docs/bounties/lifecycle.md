# Connector Bounty Lifecycle

This guide outlines the complete lifecycle of connector bounties - from initial exchange interest to final payment and maintenance.

## For Exchanges: Bounty Management Service

### 1. Exchange Contacts Foundation
Exchange reaches out via Discord or email to discuss connector integration needs. Foundation team schedules introduction call to understand requirements.

### 2. Technical Review & Scoping
Foundation reviews exchange API documentation to:
- Confirm compatibility with Hummingbot standards
- Identify required connector types (CLOB, AMM, etc.)
- Assess WebSocket/REST API capabilities
- Determine development complexity

### 3. Bounty Management Agreement
Exchange chooses to proceed with $10,000 Bounty Management service:
- **Payment**: Via crypto transfer or escrow agreement
- **Scope**: All connector types the exchange supports
- **Timeline**: 4-8 weeks total
- **Maintenance**: 1 year included

### 4. Foundation Creates Bounty Issues
Foundation posts individual bounties to [Bounties Board](https://github.com/orgs/hummingbot/projects/7/views/1):
- **New connector development** bounties (market rate)
- **Testing and QA** bounties
