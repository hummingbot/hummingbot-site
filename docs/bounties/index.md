# Connector Bounties

## Overview

Connector bounties enable community developers to build and maintain exchange connectors for Hummingbot through a flexible, transparent bounty system. The Hummingbot Foundation manages this process, connecting exchanges with skilled developers from our 40,000+ trading community.

This documentation provides information for:
- **Exchanges** looking to integrate with Hummingbot
- **Developers** interested in earning bounties by building connectors

## How It Works

The bounty system creates a sustainable ecosystem where:

1. **Exchanges** fund connector development and maintenance
2. **Foundation** manages the bounty lifecycle and quality assurance
3. **Developers** build and maintain connectors for competitive compensation
4. **Community** gains access to more trading venues

## For Exchanges
