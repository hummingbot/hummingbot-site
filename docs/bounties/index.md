# Connector Bounties

Build and maintain official **Hummingbot connectors** for your exchange through our transparent bounty-driven development model.

## What Are Connector Bounties?

Hummingbot Foundation uses bounties to fund the development and maintenance of exchange connectors in the official Hummingbot codebase. These bounties enable professional-grade integration between exchanges and Hummingbot's 40,000+ trading community.
