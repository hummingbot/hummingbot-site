If you are want to get a custom algorithmic strategy or Hummingbot connector built by a professional-grade developer, Hummingbot Foundation can help you navigate the entire development process. This includes:

- Posting the bounty on [Bounties Board](https://github.com/orgs/hummingbot/discussions/categories/bounties)
- Assigning a qualified community developer and monitoring their progress
- Reviewing the code to ensure the connector meets the acceptance criteria and other requirements
- Performing automated and manual testing (quality assurance)
- Paying the developer when the pull request is merged

To initiate the process, please post a create a new [Github Issue](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/issues/new/choose) and choose the **Bounty Request** template. You may also contact the Foundation team members on [Discord](https://discord.gg/hummingbot) to discuss your bounty.

## Bounty Types

Bounties can be classified into one of the following types:

* üêû **Bug Fix**: Fix to a bug in the Hummingbot codebase
* üîó **Connector**: A new exchange [connector](/exchanges/) that meets the current Hummingbot standard. Decentralized exchanges (DEX) are generally more complex and require more time to develop than centralized exchanges (CEX)
* üìà **Custom Strategy**: A new Hummingbot strategy - either a [Script](/scripts/) or [Controller](/v2-strategies/controllers)
* üìä **Candles Feed**: A new [candles feed](/v2-strategies/candles/) that fetches historical OHLCV data from an exchange
* üìÄ **Data Feed**: A new [data feed](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/tree/master/hummingbot/data_feed) that fetches real-time market data from an exchange
* üìù **Connector Guide**: Documentation that explains how to get started with a new Hummingbot connector and running a strategy on it
* üîº **Upgrade Connector**: Update to an existing connector in the Hummingbot codebase (due to API changes, Hummingbot standard updates, etc.)

In addition, bounties may be:

* **Open Source**: merged into the official Hummingbot codebase, or 
* **Closed Source**: delivered as a private fork to the Sponsor

## Processing Fee

Hummingbot Foundation charges Sponsors a fee for overseeing the entire lifecycle of a bounty: scoping the bounty, finding and assigning the bounty to a qualified contributor, performing engineering/QA review, and conducting payments. This saves you a lot of time and effort.

The standard processing fee is **20%**. If a sponsor submits a 1000 USDT total bounty, the fee is 200 USDT and the developer receives 800 USDT.

If the bounty is denominated in the [HBOT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xe5097d9baeafb89f9bcb78c9290d545db5f9e9cb) token, the fee is **10%**. If a sponsor submits a 100,000 HBOT total bounty, the fee is 10,000 HBOT and the developer receives 90,000 HBOT.

## Bounty Wallets

In order to fund the bounty, sponsors should send the total bounty amount to a designated Foundation wallet:

* Ethereum Mainnet: [0x60D581aEa0644e74df60c7555e5166d32665d6b6](https://etherscan.io/address/0x60D581aEa0644e74df60c7555e5166d32665d6b6)
* Binance Smart Chain: [0xE517b826a26B439eCE92f3220628eC007049d915](https://bscscan.com/address/0xE517b826a26B439eCE92f3220628eC007049d915)
* Solana: [5bhQNYaDEwEqjcjsuRJRuGyqbchzcDtYK49e593Wuc8i](https://solscan.io/account/5bhQNYaDEwEqjcjsuRJRuGyqbchzcDtYK49e593Wuc8i)

Since HBOT is an Ethereum ERC-20 token only, any HBOT-denominated bounties must be sent to the Ethereum Mainnet wallet.
