## Installation Methods

You can install Hummingbot either (1) [via Docker](./docker.md) or (2) [from source](./source/).

### Docker

We recommend installing Hummingbot using Docker if:

- You want the simplest, easiest installation method
- You don't need to modify the Hummingbot codebase
- You want to deploy Hummingbot alongside with Dashboard, Orchestation Module, and other advanced configurations

For most new users, we recommend installing Hummingbot using Docker.

See [Install via Docker](./docker.md) for more info.

### Source

We recommend installing Hummingbot from source if:

- You want to customize or extend the Hummingbot codebase
- You want to build new components like connectors or strategies
- You want to learn how Hummingbot works at a deeper, technical level

See [Install from Source](./source/) or these guides for various environments:

* [Linux](./linux.md)
* [Windows](./windows.md)
* [MacOS](./mac.md)
* [Raspberry Pi](./raspberry-pi.md)

## Post-Installation

After you have successfully installed Hummingbot, See [Post-Installation](./post-installation.md) for how to manage the folder structure, launch/exit the client, update it, etc. Then, check out the [Getting Started] guides(/getting-started) to build and run a trading bot!

## MQTT Brokers Repo

See [Brokers](./broker.md) for more information orchestrating multiple instances of Hummingbot using MQTT message brokers.

## Hummingbot in the Cloud

For experienced users, we recommend running Hummingbot in a cloud instance, which enables your bots to run continually with minimized downtime.

Hummingot Docker instances takes up around 500 MB of storage space and 4 GB for Hummingbot Docker images. We have successfully installed and run Hummingbot on the following machine types:

| Provider              | Instance Type   | Instance Details      |
| --------------------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| Google Cloud Platform | g1-small        | 2 vCPU, 4 GB memory |
| Amazon Web Services   | t2.small        | 2 vCPU, 4 GB memory   |
| Microsoft Azure       | Standard_D2s_v3 | 2 vCPU, 8 GB memory   |

These instances are pre-loaded with system files that takes up around 1.2 GB so we recommend having at least **8 GB of storage space** in your cloud server.
