# Raspberry Pi / ARM64

The following steps are for the Raspberry Pi but it should also work with any other device that uses the same ARM architecture.

Running Hummingbot on a Raspberry Pi or similar device has the same main benefit of running it on a cloud server: having a dedicated machine for Hummingbot. Raspberry Pi’s are relatively low cost, easy to set up, and, of course, don’t have the monthly charges associated with a cloud provider.

## Prerequisites

### Download 64-bit OS

To run Hummingbot on a Raspberry Pi, a 64-bit OS is required as it won't work with 32-bit. You can download the 64-bit OS from the [Raspberry Pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-64-bit) or from the [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi) website.

You can also choose between CLI (command line) and Desktop GUI versions but you'll get more performance with just using the CLI version.

### Load the image file to your Raspberry Pi’s SD card

The Raspberry Pi has an easy to follow [guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/) with alternatives on how to load the SD card with a Raspberry Pi OS from different operating systems.

Once the OS is installed and booted then you can follow the steps below to install Hummingbot using either Docker or Source

## **Install via Docker**

Copy and paste each line of code one by one into the terminal

```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
sudo systemctl start docker && sudo systemctl enable docker
```

!!! warning
    This step is important — make sure to close and restart your terminal window to enable the correct permissions for `docker` command before proceeding.

```
exit
```

Once Docker is installed you can then launch a Hummingbot instance with **_either_** of the following options:

- **Scripts**: download and use automated Docker scripts
- **Manual**: run install commands manually

!!! note  
    The Raspberry Pi uses a different processor architecture (ARM) which means you'll need to use a specific Docker image that was built for the ARM architecture. When running the `./create.sh` command or creating the Docker instance manually you'll have to specify the image to use which is usually in this format - `version-[version_number]-arm_beta` The latest ARM versions can be found here (filter list by "arm") - [Hummingbot DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/hummingbot/hummingbot/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated&name=arm)

=== "Scripts"

    ```bash
    # 1) Download Hummingbot install, start, and update script
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/development/installation/docker-commands/create.sh
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/development/installation/docker-commands/start.sh
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/development/installation/docker-commands/update.sh

    # 2) Enable script permissions
    chmod a+x *.sh

    # 3) Create a hummingbot instance
    ./create.sh

    # 4) Pull Hummingbot ARM image when asked what version to use
    Enter Hummingbot version: [ latest/development ] ( default = 'latest' )
    >> version-1.12.0-arm_beta
    ```

=== "Manual"

    ```bash
    # 1) Create folder for your new instance
    mkdir hummingbot_files

    # 2) Create folders for logs, config files and database file
    mkdir hummingbot_files/hummingbot_conf
    mkdir hummingbot_files/hummingbot_logs
    mkdir hummingbot_files/hummingbot_data
    mkdir hummingbot_files/hummingbot_scripts

    # 3) Launch a new instance of hummingbot
    docker run -it \
    --network host \
    --name hummingbot-instance \
    --mount "type=bind,source=$(pwd)/hummingbot_files/hummingbot_conf,destination=/conf/" \
    --mount "type=bind,source=$(pwd)/hummingbot_files/hummingbot_logs,destination=/logs/" \
    --mount "type=bind,source=$(pwd)/hummingbot_files/hummingbot_data,destination=/data/" \
    --mount "type=bind,source=$(pwd)/hummingbot_files/hummingbot_scripts,destination=/scripts/" \
    hummingbot/hummingbot:version-1.12.0-arm_beta
    ```

## **Install via Source**

Open a terminal (GUI) or SSH into the Raspberry Pi and copy / paste the following code line by line into the terminal

Update the repository and install important dependencies

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev gcc python3-dev python-dev python3.7 -y
```

Install Miniforge

```
wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/download/4.11.0-4/Miniforge3-4.11.0-4-Linux-aarch64.sh
sh Miniforge3-4.11.0-4-Linux-aarch64.sh
```

Restart the terminal

```
exec bash
```

Install `conda-build`

```
conda install conda-build
```

Clone the Hummingbot repository

```
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot.git
```

!!! note
    If you need to switch branches (ie. `development` branch) then after cloning the repository use the command `git checkout [branch_name]` to switch branches. For example, to switch to the development branch use `git checkout development`

Change directory into the Hummingbot folder

```
cd hummingbot
```

!!! note
    If you are using Ubuntu 22.04 you'll need to go into the `./setup` folder first and edit the `environment-linux-aarch64.yml` file and change "cryptography==2.8" to "cryptography==3.1.1" before running the `./install` command otherwise you'll get an error "could not build wheels for cryptography"

Run the `install` command

```
./install
```

Activate the `conda` environment

```
conda activate hummingbot
```

Clean your Hummingbot directory and then compile

```
./clean && ./compile
```

Launch Hummingbot

```
bin/hummingbot.py
```
