# Hummingbot Collaborates With Binance

![cover](cover.png)


Hummingbot is excited to announce that it is working with [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en) on two strategic initiatives:

1. Bringing new algorithmic traders to Binance using Hummingbot and
2. Expanding liquidity mining with an issuer referral program.

Hummingbot is an open-source crypto trading software client that allows users to trade cryptocurrency with high-frequency trading strategies such as market making and arbitrage. Hummingbot currently supports nine exchanges, both centralized and decentralized. Binance was among the first exchanges that Hummingbot supported at launch.

Binance is a global cryptocurrency exchange that provides a platform for trading more than 100 cryptocurrencies. Since early 2018, Binance has been considered as the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world in terms of trading volume.

In early March, Hummingbot launched the inaugural liquidity mining campaigns, a series of community-driven liquidity programs for four token projects listed on Binance. Within the first two weeks, 155 individual traders participated in the campaigns, earning as much as $200 in weekly rewards and collectively generating over [$7 million of filled order volume](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hummingbot/comments/fkxlsl/daily_update_march_18_2020_two_week_recap/).

To turbocharge the growth, we are working closely with Binance to expand the usage of Hummingbot on the exchange as well as participation in liquidity mining. Hummingbot provides all users easy-to-use infrastructure for automated trading of their favorite tokens on Binance. We believe that working with Binance will allow us to combine the strengths of both Binance’s state-of-the-art platform and our innovative high frequency trading infrastructure.

Binance will be contributing a portion of the trading fees generated from new Binance users trading with Hummingbot to help further develop the Hummingbot platform and community. We encourage members of the Hummingbot community to sign up and create new Binance accounts to help support us!

In addition, Binance will be working with the Hummingbot team to support liquidity mining by referring token issuers who want to support liquidity for their tokens to run liquidity mining campaigns as an alternative to hiring traditional crypto market makers / quant hedge funds. Compared to traditional market makers, liquidity mining provides a lower cost, data-driven way to generate liquidity. It gives issuers a way to diversify sources of liquidity, reward their own communities for contributing to market making, and encourage Hummingbot’s community of quant/algo traders to trade in the issuer’s tokens.
