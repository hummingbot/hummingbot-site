# Hummingbot Partners with KuCoin

![cover](cover.png)

**Hummingbot is thrilled to announce that it has partnered with leading crypto exchange [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/) to bring Hummingbot’s trading capabilities to the exchange.**

#### KuCoin Exchange Connector

Integrating Hummingbot to KuCoin will enable KuCoin's account holders to deploy Hummingbot’s quantitative and algorithmic strategies to engage in high frequency, automated trading.  Currently available strategies include market making, arbitrage, liquidity mirroring, as well as trade execution strategies such as TWAP and VWAP execution.  Hummingbot also allows users to create their own custom strategies.

Development of the KuCoin exchange connector is already underway.  The connector is currently undergoing testing and we expect to release the integration by the end of January 2020.
