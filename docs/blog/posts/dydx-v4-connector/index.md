# Announcing the New dYdX V4 Connector in Hummingbot!

![dYdX V4 Connector](dydx.png)

We're thrilled to introduce the brand-new dYdX V4 connector in the Hummingbot v2.0.1 release! This update integrates Hummingbot with the dYdX V4 Chain, enabling users to run advanced market-making and algo trading strategies on dYdX!

This release marks a significant milestone in the collaboration between the [Hummingbot Foundation](/about/) and the dYdX ecosystem. Earlier this year, we awarded a grant from the [dYdX Grants Program](https://dydxgrants.com/) to support the development of the dYdX V4 connector and to evangelize usage.

## Key Benefits

- **Access to a Leading Perp DEX**: This connector opens the door for thousands of market makers and algo traders who build on top of the Hummingbot framework to access and trade on dYdX, a leading decentralized perpetual contract exchange. This access empowers traders to tap into dYdX's deep liquidity and innovative trading features.
- **Supported by the Latest Hummingbot V2 Framework**: The connector is fully integrated with the latest [Hummingbot V2 framework](/v2-strategies/), which includes powerful tools for backtesting and multi-bot deployment. This means traders can now optimize and deploy multiple trading strategies simultaneously, all while utilizing the advanced capabilities of the Hummingbot V2 infrastructure.
- **Community-Driven Strategy Sharing**: The Hummingbot community now has the opportunity to develop and share dYdX-specific trading strategies and dashboard pages. This collaboration fosters innovation and helps traders leverage collective knowledge, making it easier to succeed on the dYdX platform.

## Installation Instructions

Due to some dependency conflicts with other Hummingbot connectors, we have created a custom Docker image and custom scripts to help users install Hummingbot with dYdX.

### Docker

1. **Open your `docker-compose.yml` file** (usually located in your Hummingbot project directory).
2. **Update the image line** under the Hummingbot service:
    - For the latest stable version, use:
        ```yaml
        image: hummingbot/hummingbot:latest_dydx
        ```
    - For the development version, use:
        ```yaml
        image: hummingbot/hummingbot:development_dydx
        ```

### Source

1. **Clone the Hummingbot repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Hummingbot directory**:
    ```bash
    cd hummingbot
    ```
3. **Run the install command with the `-dydx` flag**:
    ```bash
    ./install --dydx
    ```
4. **Activate the Hummingbot environment**:
    ```bash
    conda activate hummingbot
    ```
5. **Compile the code**:
    ```bash
    ./compile
    ```
