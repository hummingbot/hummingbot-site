# Epoch 6 Polls Recap

![](./1.png)

Every quarter, Hummingbot Foundation organizes [Polls](../../../governance/polls.md), a quarterly process that lets HBOT holders vote on how the Foundation distributes its maintenance resources and bounty budgets across the 50+ CEX, DEX, and blockchain network connectors in the Hummingbot codebase.

This week, we completed the Epoch 6 polls which decide which connectors will be included in the Hummingbot codebase for the October, November, and December 2023 releases.

Read on to learn about which connectors made the cut!

For Epoch 6, we implemented three major changes approved inÂ **[[HGP-45] Proposed Epoch 6 Governance Changes](https://snapshot.org/#/hbot.eth/proposal/0x7807da661f09096db6aadb277051ed6defd580259fd8e503c2a77a83779a3fd5)**Â proposal. Here are the summarized details:

- **Chain Connector Voting Introduction**: Added Chain Connector voting
- **Bounty Allocations**: Formalized quarterly HBOT bounty allocations of 400K for Gold connectors and 100K for Silver connectors
- **Adjustment of Connector Inclusion Threshold**: Increased threshold to 200K HBOT to keep connectors in the codebase for the next quarter.

These changes aim to sustain our bounties program and facilitate further development of our codebases. We trust that they will aid in fostering a collaborative, productive, and beneficial environment for our community.

Below, we summarize the results of the Epoch 6 Polls and outline the changes we'll make over the next quarter.

## CEX Connectors
