## Installation

### Docker: Permission denied error

```plaintext
docker: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at
unix:///var/run/docker.sock...

```

The error message above indicates a permission issue while trying to access the Docker daemon socket. This is a common problem when trying to run Docker commands as a non-root user. To add your user to the docker group, use the following command:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Restart the terminal after running the command above, if it still doesn't work try the command below

sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

```


### Source: conda command not found

```
$ conda
-bash: conda: command not found
```

Ensure Anaconda, Miniconda, or Miniforge (for arm64 systems) is installed. If you've just installed it, restart your terminal to refresh the command line environment.

### Source: ./install: line 40 ... Killed

```plaintext
Collecting package metadata (repodata.json): / ./install: line 40: 14981 Killed...

```
This error shows up during installation, typically on systems with 2GB RAM or less. Increase your system's RAM to at least 4GB, or consider adding a swap file if upgrading hardware is not feasible.

### Source: Could not find conda environment: hummingbot

![Alt text](troubleshooting/conda.png)

This is related to the issue above. Check if there are any errors after running the `./install` script. If there are, you'll need to solve those first otherwise creating the hummingbot conda environment will fail. 

### Source: unable to execute `gcc`: No such file or directory

![Alt text](troubleshooting/gcc.png)

If getting this error you'll need to install the `build-essential` package. Run the command below to install - 

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt install -y build-essential
```

## Dashboard

### Failed to connect MQTT Bridge:

```bash
00:21:16 - hummingbot_application - Failed to connect MQTT Bridge: 
[Errno 111] Connection refused. Retrying in 10.0 seconds.
```

If you get this error, this usually means the Hummingbot Broker is not running, start the Broker from the Instances page and then restart all Hummingbot client instances. 


### Docker is not running. Please start Docker and refresh the page.

![Alt text](troubleshooting/instances.png)

Make sure you have Docker installed. On Windows and MacOS machines make sure you have Docker Desktop running in the background. 

### No module named hummingbot

![Alt text](troubleshooting/wheel.png)

Note: The name of the missing module could be something else like `st_pages` etc. If you get this message this means the environment wasn't installed properly. Run the following steps in a terminal to reinstall - 

```bash
conda deactivate
make env_remove
make env_create
conda activate dashboard
make run
```

### Authentication page is not showing in Dashboard

By default the authentication system is disabled. 

Find the variable `AUTH_SYSTEM_ENABLED` in the `CONFIG.py` file and set it to `True` to enable the authentication page.

```

If you are getting this error on Kraken, or a similar error on a different exchange this is because the exchange connector doesn't currently support market orders which the PositionExecutor needs to close the position. 

## Connectors

## Gateway

### Client is stuck on `"script_strategy_base - uniswap_ethereum_mainnet is not ready. Please wait..."`

You'll need to approve tokens that you are trading. See below for an example if you are trading WETH on Ethereum mainnet

```bash
gateway approve-tokens uniswap_ethereum_mainnet WETH
```

!!! note
    When approving tokens, if you get a "Token not Supported" error, please make sure to add the token address in the tokenlist manually. The token list can be found in the `./conf/list` folder

### Tokens not showing in `balance` command

![Alt text](troubleshooting/tokens.png)

Use the following command to display token balances for different networks. 

```bash
>>> gateway connector-tokens uniswap_ethereum_goerli WETH,DAI
```


## Misc


### Unable to paste, getting an error message

```bash
 Pyperclip could not find a copy/paste mechanism for your system.
    For more information, please visit https://pyperclip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#not-implemented-error
```

This error comes up because <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> doesn't work in Hummingbot. Try any of the following shortcuts below to paste. 

```
Shift + Insert 
CTRL + SHIFT + Right Click  
CTRL + SHIFT + V
```

### How to exit a config

![Alt text](troubleshooting/config.png)

Press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> if you want to cancel out of the configuration 

### Balance showing but it's not showing Total in ($)

![Alt text](troubleshooting/balance.png)

If one or more tokens is showing 0 `Total in ($)`, use the command below to change your rate oracle source. By default, the `rate_oracle_source` is set to `Binance` and if the token is not available in Binance then the `Total in ($)` will show 0. 

```bash
config rate_oracle_source
```
