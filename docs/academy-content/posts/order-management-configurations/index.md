* The essentials of order management for market makers;
* Managing orders using the Hummingbot Client;
* The rationale behind traders' frequent offer adjustments in order books;
* Understanding and implementing order optimization;
* Enhancing order management with scripts.

## Order Management: The Market Maker's Survival Toolkit

You've installed Hummingbot, initiated a `pure_market_making` strategy, and started it. Perhaps youâ€™re now anticipating profits with minimal further intervention. While automation is a key feature (and there are ways to enhance it), it's unwise to entirely disregard ongoing bot management.

As discussed in our [introduction article](../what-is-market-making/index.md), market-making profits primarily derive from capturing the market spread, optimally in a sideways-moving market.

However, markets are dynamic. Successfully capturing market spreads involves discerning whether current order flows originate from informed or uninformed traders.

## Informed vs. Uninformed Traders: A Critical Distinction

Market participants have varied motives for trading specific assets, but fundamentally, these motives are either informed or uninformed. 

An **uninformed trade** ignores the anticipated market price direction in the near or distant future. Conversely, an **informed trade** leverages available information (such as insider insights, fundamental, or technical analysis) to align with the predicted price movement.

**Market makers** thrive on **uninformed trades**, which suggest no clear price direction and potentially longer periods of sideways movement, enabling more spread capture.

## Adaptation Equals Survival

In a market dominated by **uninformed traders**, **market makers** could simply set their desired spread and activate their bots. However, the entrance of **informed traders** often signals an imminent directional shift, posing a risk, as discussed in our [inventory risk article](../what-is-inventory-risk/index.md). In response, market makers may adjust spreads differently for uptrends and downtrends to mitigate risk.

Adapting to these dynamics is essential, and **order management** is the primary tool for this.

## Managing Orders with Hummingbot

Hummingbot users can tailor their order management strategy using the `config` command. Key strategy parameters related to order management include:

#### **bid_spread & ask_spread**

Adjusting bid and ask spreads is central to market-making strategies. This parameter sets the percentage from the `price_type` for order creation. Spreads may be modified in response to changing market conditions or volatility. For further details on price configurations, see [this article](../commands-and-configs-price-source/index.md).

#### **order_amount**

The size of each order is critical. Incorrect sizing could deplete your inventory, limiting trading ability. The chosen `order_amount` must align with your overall strategy and account for factors like existing inventory and market conditions.

#### **order_refresh_time & filled_order_delay**

These settings control the frequency of order creation and cancellation, distinguishing between High Frequency and Low Frequency trading strategies. Finding a balance is crucial to avoid missing opportunities or making undesirable trades.

#### **order_refresh_tolerance_pct**

This setting helps maintain order priority in the order book. A non-zero `order_refresh_tolerance_pct` prevents order cancellation and recreation for minor price changes, thus retaining your position in the order queue.

#### **minimum_spread**

Setting a `minimum_spread` ensures your orders maintain a minimum distance from the market price, adjusting dynamically to market movements.

## Sample Configuration

```json
- bid_spread : 0.50
- ask_spread : 0.50
- minimum_spread : 0.49
- order_refresh_time : 60.0
```

With the configuration above, buy and sell orders are set at a 0.5% spread from the mid-price.

```
00:28:31 - Creating 1 bid orders at (Size, Price): ['0.05 ETH, 227.41USDC']
00:28:31 - Creating 1 ask orders at (Size, Price): ['0.05 ETH, 229.69USDC']
00:28:31 - Created LIMIT_MAKER BUY order x-XEKWYICX-BEHUC1593217711001924 for 0.05000000 ETHUSDC.
00:28:31 - Created LIMIT_MAKER SELL order x-XEKWYICX-SEHUC1593217711002203 for 0.05000000 ETHUSDC.
```

```
Orders:
   Level  Type  Price Spread Amount (Orig)  Amount (Adj)       Age
       1  sell 229.69  0.49%          0.05          0.05  00:00:00
       1   buy 227.41  0.50%          0.05          0.05  00:00:00
```

Even before the 60 seconds refresh time was up, the sell order was cancelled when its spread went below the minimum.

```
00:28:40 - Order is below minimum spread (0.0049). Cancelling Order: (Sell) ID - x-XEKWYICX-SEHUC1593217711002203
00:28:40 - Cancelling the limit order x-XEKWYICX-SEHUC1593217711002203.
```

```
Orders:
   Level Type  Price Spread Amount (Orig)  Amount (Adj)       Age
       1  buy 227.41  0.52%          0.05          0.05  00:00:12
```

In the next order refresh new buy and sell orders with 0.5% spreads will be created.

## Conclusion

Your market-making strategy might be straightforward or use a hundred different indicators to make calculations and decisions of what must be done.

But keep in mind that, at the end of this process, a fundamental question must be asked (and answered):

**What must be done with the orders?**

How and when the orders must be created (or canceled) on the market is the final decision that your strategy must answer. Understanding how orders are managed is a crucial piece of finding a profitable strategy.
