## Let's code

Open the codebase in your favorite IDE such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and follow the steps below:

Create a new file inside the scripts folder and name it `quickstart_script.py`

Add the following code to the `quickstart_script.py` file:

```Python
from hummingbot.strategy.script_strategy_base import ScriptStrategyBase
class QuickstartScript(ScriptStrategyBase):
  # It is recommended to first use a paper trade exchange connector 
  # while coding your strategy, and then switch to a real one once you're happy with it.
  markets = {"binance_paper_trade": {"BTC-USDT"}}
  # Next, let's code the logic that will be executed every tick_size (default=1sec)
  def on_tick(self):
      price = self.connectors["binance_paper_trade"].get_mid_price("BTC-USDT")
      msg = f"Bitcoin price: ${price}"
      self.logger().info(msg)
      self.notify_hb_app_with_timestamp(msg)
```

- The `on_tick`Â method runs for every tick that the bot internal clock executes. By default, the `tick_size` is 1 second, and you can adjust this parameter in the global `conf_client.yml` config file.
- All the connectors that you defined on `markets` are initialized when the script starts. You can access them in the class by calling `self.connectors`, which is a dictionary with the following structure: `Dict[CONNECTOR_NAME, ConnectorBase]`.
- To get the mid-price of Bitcoin, we are using the connector `binance_paper_trade` by calling the `get_mid_price` method, i.e. `self.connectors["binance_paper_trade"].get_mid_price("BTC-USDT")`
- The logic to get the mid-price for any connector is: `self.connectors[CONNECTOR_NAME].get_mid_price(TRADING_PAIR)`. Make sure that you define the connector and trading pair in `markets` before using them.
- `self.logger().info(msg)`Â prints the message in `msg` to your Hummingbot log panel (right hand pane) and saves it to the log file, which is in `logs/log_quickstart_script.log`Â .
- `self.notify_hb_app_with_timestamp(msg)`Â sends the message to the Hummingbot output panel (top left pane). If you have set upÂ [Telegram bot integration](https://hummingbot.org/global-configs/telegram/), you will get the message on your Telegram chat as well.  

## Running the script

![Alt text](Untitled%201.png)

Start Hummingbot:

- If you installed Hummingbot from source, you should open Terminal/Bash and run the client with `./start` (make sure to run `conda activate hummingbot` first).

- If you donâ€™t have Hummingbot running already and you are using Docker, start and attach the container by following these instructions: [https://docs.hummingbot.org/installation/docker/](https://docs.hummingbot.org/installation/docker/)

Once you are inside Hummingbot, run this command to start your script:

```
start --script quickstart_script.py
```

Run theÂ `status` command to see the current status of your running script:

![Alt text](../../../scripts/script-status.png)

## Notes and tips

- You can define multiple connectors and multiple trading pairs, e.g.

```
  markets = { "binance_paper_trade": {"BTC-USDT", "ETH-USDT"}, 
            "kucoin_paper_trade": {"LUNA-USDT"}
          }
```

- You will see a sqlite database (`/data/quickstart_script.sqlite`) and a log file (`/logs/log_quickstart_script.log`) created for your script

- Your script is loaded up at runtime, so you donâ€™t have to exit Hummingbot while you are updating your script code. You will just need toÂ `stop`Â (to stop the current execution) and start it again with the commandÂ `start --script script.py`Â again.

!!! tip
    ðŸ’¡ If you have already run the script and the file name is in the top status bar, then you can run it again with just the `start` command instead of adding the script name.

- If you want to use a real connector instead of a paper trade one, first you need to configure it using theÂ `connect`Â command and provide all the required API credentials. See <https://docs.hummingbot.org/client/connect/> for more details.

- Use the <kbd>â†‘</kbd> key in the client to cycle through the list of previous commands

- UseÂ [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/)Â or another free database management tool to open the sqlite database to see what the data that Hummingbot stores for you.

## Next steps

Now that you understand how a Hummingbot script works, let's [implement a basic market making script](custom-pmm-2.md)!
