# `pangolin`

The Pangolin connector in [Gateway](/gateway) is responsible for all on-chain operations (e.g. fetching prices and creating swap transactions).

It interfaces with the [`GatewayEVMAMM`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/connector/gateway_EVM_AMM.py) class in the Hummingbot client, which is responsible for interfacing with all EVM-based Gateway AMMs.

## 🔑 Setup

1. Follow the instructions on [Setting up Gateway](/gateway/setup) to install the Gateway Docker container
2. Run `gateway connect pangolin` and follow the prompts to add your wallet private key. Like all API and private keys in Hummingbot, this key is encrypted with your Hummingbot password.
3. Afterwards, run `create` to create an [AMM Arbitrage](/strategies/amm-arbitrage/) strategy between Pangolin and a different exchange.
4. Run `start` to start the strategy!
