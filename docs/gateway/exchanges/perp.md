# `Perpetual Protocol`

The Perpetual Protocol connector in [Gateway](/gateway) is responsible for all on-chain operations (e.g. fetching prices and creating swap transactions).

It interfaces with the [`GatewayEVMPerpetual`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/connector/gateway_EVM_Perpetual.py) class in the Hummingbot client, which is responsible for interfacing with EVM-based perpetual AMMs.
