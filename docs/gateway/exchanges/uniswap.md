# `uniswap` and `uniswapLP`

The Uniswap connector in [Gateway](/gateway) is responsible for all on-chain operations (e.g. fetching prices and creating swap transactions).

It interfaces with the [`GatewayEVMAMM`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/connector/gateway_EVM_AMM.py) class in the Hummingbot client, which is responsible for interfacing with EVM-based AMMs.

In addition, the `uniswapLP` connector interfaces with the [`GatewayEVMAMMLP`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/connector/gateway_EVM_AMM.py) class in the Hummingbot client, which is responsible for interfacing with liquidity provision-related functions in EVM-based AMMs.

## 🔑 Setup

### Swapping tokens

1. Follow the instructions on [Setting up Gateway](/gateway/setup) to install the Gateway Docker container
2. Run `gateway connect uniswap` and follow the prompts to add your wallet private key. Like all API and private keys in Hummingbot, this key is encrypted with your Hummingbot password.
3. Afterwards, run `create` to create an [AMM Arbitrage](/strategies/amm-arbitrage/) strategy between Uniswap and a different exchange.
4. Run `start` to start the strategy!

### Adding and removing concentrated liquidity ranges

1. Follow the instructions on [Setting up Gateway](/gateway/setup) to install the Gateway Docker container
2. Run `gateway connect uniswapLP` and follow the prompts to add your wallet private key. Like all API and private keys in Hummingbot, this key is encrypted with your Hummingbot password.
3. Afterwards, run `create` to create a [Uniswap-V3 LP](/strategies/uniswap-v3-lp/) strategy to create and dynamically adjust a Uniswap-V3 LP position factoring in market price and volatility.
4. Run `start` to start the strategy!
