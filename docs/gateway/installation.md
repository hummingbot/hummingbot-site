The official Github repository for Gateway is <https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway>. Gateway is released monthly with the same cadence as the [Hummingbot client](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot), and it follows the same conventions for releases, contributions, etc.

## Install with Docker 

For most users, this is the recommended install method for Hummingbot and Gateway

[![](./gateway.gif)](./gateway.gif)


Navigate to the Hummingbot root folder in your terminal or if you haven't cloned the Hummingbot repo yet run the command below

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot
cd hummingbot
```

Modify [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) in the root folder using a text editor or IDE like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Uncomment the Gateway-related lines as shown below
```yaml
  gateway:
    container_name: "gateway"
    image: hummingbot/gateway:latest    
    ports:
      - "15888:15888"
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - "./gateway_files/conf:/usr/src/app/conf"
      - "./gateway_files/logs:/usr/src/app/logs"
      - "./hummingbot_files/certs:/home/gateway/certs"
    environment:
      - GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE=a
```

### Start instance 

From the Hummingbot root folder, run the following command in a terminal to start the instances and attach to it:

```
docker compose up -d
docker attach hummingbot
```

### Generate certs

Once attached to Hummingbot, run the following command within the Hummingbot terminal to generate the Gateway certificates:

```
gateway generate-certs
```

[![](./generate-certs.png)](./generate-certs.png)

You'll be prompted to add a passphrase to encrypt the gateway certificates. This can be different from your Hummingbot login password. Take note of this gateway passphrase.

Afterwards, run `exit` to exit Hummingbot.

Back in the terminal, use the following command to stop and exit out of all containers:

```
docker compose down
```

### Add passphrase to YAML file

Now, use a text editor or an IDE like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to edit the `docker-compose.yml` file again.

Add the passphrase that you just defined as the `GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE` environment variable, and save the file.

```yaml
  environment:
    - GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE=a
```

### Restart instance

Now, restart the instance and attach to it:
```
docker compose up -d
docker attach hummingbot
```

You should now see `GATEWAY:ONLINE` in the upper-right hand corner.

After Gateway is running, see [Testing](testing.md) to understand how to test the endpoints on a standalone basis before using it with Hummingbot.

### Check Gateway logs

To see the logs from the `gateway` instance, run:

```
docker logs gateway
```

---

## Install from Source

You can also install Gateway on a standalone basis and then link it to Hummingbot manually. These instructions assume that you have already installed Hummingbot on the machine where you are installing Gateway, either from source or via Docker.

### Prerequisites

Install the following dependencies:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (use 20.0.0 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/): run `npm install -g pnpm` after installing NodeJS

### Installation

Clone the Gateway repo and navigate into the folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway.git
cd gateway
```

Install Javascript dependencies:
```
pnpm install
```

Compile Typescript into Javascript:
```
pnpm build
```

Run Gateway

```
pnpm start
```

### Generate certs

Next, generate self-signed certificates from the Hummingbot client. These certificates let your bots securely communicate with Gateway.

Start Hummingbot. After entering your password, run `gateway generate-certs`:

[![](./generate-certs.png)](./generate-certs.png)

Enter a secure **passphrase**, and write it down. Hummingbot will generate self-signed certificates that a server can use to authenticate its connection with this client.

Take note of the **certs_path** where they are stored. This is also stored as `certs_path` in the Hummingbot's `conf_client.yml`, the global configuration file in the `/conf/` directory.

[![](./certs-path.png)](./certs-path.png)

Note that you will be prompted to enter both **passphrase** and **certs_path** later to complete the installation process.

### Run setup script

The `gateway-setup` script, located in the root Gateway directory, performs the following actions:

* Copies the default Gateway configuration files from `/src/templates` to `/conf/` folder
* Copies the Hummingbot certificates into the `/certs/` folder.

Enable permissions and run setup script:

```
chmod a+x gateway-setup.sh
./gateway-setup.sh

```

When prompted, enter **certs_path** from the prior step:

```
ℹ️ Confirm if this is correct:

            Copy configs FROM: [/folder]/gateway/src/templates
              Copy configs TO: [/folder]/gateway/conf

              Copy certs FROM: [/folder]/hummingbot/certs
                Copy certs TO: [/folder]/gateway/certs

Do you want to proceed? [Y/N] >>> 
```


!!! note "Alternative to copying certs files"
    The `gateway-setup.sh` script creates a copy of the Hummingbot certificates in the Gateway folder. Alternatively, you can override the **certs_path** parameter in `conf/server.yml` and enter the path to the Hummingbot certificates.


### Start Gateway

Afterwards, start Gateway using the same **passphrase** that you used to generate the certs:

```
$ pnpm start --passphrase=<passphrase>
```

You should see Gateway running on the default port 15888:
```bash
2023-02-09 12:56:50 | info | 	⚡️ Starting Gateway API on port 15888...
2023-02-09 12:56:50 | info | 	The gateway server is secured behind HTTPS.
2023-02-09 12:56:50 | info | 	⚡️ Swagger listening on port 8080. Read the Gateway API documentation at 127.0.0.1:8080
```

Go back to your Hummingbot client or restart it if you have exited. In the upper right corner, you should see **GATEWAY: ONLINE** if your Hummingbot client is connected to Gateway.

After Gateway is running, see [Testing](testing.md) to understand how to test the endpoints on a standalone basis before using it with Hummingbot.
