# Release Notes - Version 1.8.0

*Released on September 30, 2022*

- **Install via Docker**: [Linux](/installation/docker/#linuxubuntu) | [Windows](/installation/docker/#windows) | [macOS](/installation/docker/#macos) | [Raspberry Pi](/installation/raspberry-pi/#install-via-docker)

We are very excited to ship the September 2022 Hummingbot release (v1.8.0) today!

## Variable Tick Size

Previously, the default tick size (how long it takes Hummingbot to loop through a strategy iteration) was set at 1 second. Now, users can adjust this setting and define a custom `tick_size` parameter.

- [5649](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/5649) added `tick_size` as a variable, allowing the tick size to be changed in the `conf_client.yml` file or by running `config tick_size`

## New Connector: Serum

Project Serum is a Solana-based decentralized liquidity infrastructure protocol that brings a fully functional centralized exchange experience – full central limit order books, matching engine, fast settlement and trading, and low transaction costs – to the DeFi marketplace at scale.

See the `Serum` documentation for more information, as well as [this forum thread](https://forum.hummingbot.org/t/solana-serum-dex-connector-progress-follow-up-thread/207) for future plans for this connector.

**Thanks to [MHHukiewitz](https://github.com/MHHukiewitz) and [Danilo-Araujo-Silva](https://github.com/Danilo-Araujo-Silva) for this fix! 🙏**

## New Community Tool: Hummingbot Postprocess

A companion tool that helps you visualise and analyse performance of Hummingbot trade logs.
