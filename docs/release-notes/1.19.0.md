## V2 Strategy Framework

!!! warning "Under Active Development"
    V2 Strategies are still in active development and haven't been officially released yet. For those eager to explore, you can test the initial templates for directional and market-making strategies in this [pull request](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6520).

The new [V2 Strategy Framework](/v2-strategies) significantly expands Hummingbot's capabilities, allowing users to create modular, backtestable, and sophisticated strategies. Unlike the monolithic V1 strategies, V2 Strategies are designed to be highly adaptable, allowing seamless integration of various components. Whether you're a technical expert or a trading novice, you can easily create, backtest, and deploy strategies via [Dashboard](/dashboard).

We're introducing specialized templates for different trading paradigms, including Market Making, Directional, and future strategy types. These new strategy templates allow users to combine different composable components:

* Candles: These structure both historical and real-time market data into OHLCV format, generating refined signals for trading decisions.
* Controllers: These orchestrate the overall strategy, deciding which Executors to deploy or adjust based on signals generated by Candles.
* Executors: These are the operational elements that handle precise trade execution, adapt to market changes, and manage the order lifecycle.

## New Dashboard Features

!!! warning "Under Active Development"
    Dashboard is still under active development. If you're excited to explore its initial capabilities, you can find the first version [here](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard).

The **Bot Orchestration** section enables you to effortlessly deploy and manage multiple instances of Hummingbot. Key updates include:

- **Master Bot Credentials**: Now you can use a single set of credentials to manage all your bot instances, streamlining the setup process.  
- **Enhanced Bot Status Formatting**: We've added a specialized parser that neatly formats the status of running bots, making it easier to monitor their activity.

The **Backtest Manager** section is designed to help you fine-tune your trading strategies using historical data. This month, we started to add the initial components, including integration with the Optuna optimization framework and minimal versions of the initial pages.

Watch this video to see how to deploy Dashboard on AWS:

It's important to note that the Hummingbot Dashboard is currently in its beta phase, which means new features and improvements are being added continuously. While the Dashboard offers a variety of functionalities, it is not yet a polished, finalized product. We highly encourage user feedback at this stage; your insights can greatly help us fine-tune the Dashboard's capabilities and user experience. Feel free to share your thoughts and suggestions on Discord or Github.

## New Script Examples

Here are new script examples added to the codebase in this release, along with demo videos:

### Fixed Grid

[fixed_grid.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/fixed_grid.py): The script implements a fixed grid trading strategy, placing buy and sell orders at predetermined price levels, rebalancing assets if required, and providing status updates on trades and balances. **Pull Request:** [#6495](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6495)

<iframe style="width:100%; min-height:400px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1j81gP2ToCE?si=bl9IG5yQ0kTM2bTr" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**Thanks to [rkc2000](https://github.com/rkc2000) for this script and video! üôè**

### Wallet Hedging

[wallet_hedge_example.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/wallet_hedge_example.py): The script implements a fixed grid trading strategy, placing buy and sell orders at predetermined price levels, rebalancing assets if required, and providing status updates on trades and balances. **Pull Request:** [#6495](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6496)

### Arbitrage with Smart Component

[arbitrage_with_smart_component.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/arbitrage_with_smart_component.py): The script defines an `ArbitrageWithSmartComponent` class that automates cryptocurrency arbitrage trading between CEX / DEX exchanges, ensuring sufficient balances and managing active and closed arbitrage executions. It uses [ArbitrageExecutor](/v2-strategies/executors/#arbitrage-executors), a new Hummingbot component designed to simplify and automate your arbitrage trading strategies. Part of the V2 Strategy Framework, this component is engineered to assess arbitrage profitability, execute buy and sell orders across  multiple trading pairs, and provide real-time status updates. It also offers detailed metrics on profitability and transaction costs, along with configurable settings for arbitrage strategies.

## New Injective spot and perpetual Connectors

We've rolled out Python-native connectors that eliminates the need for Gateway when trading on Injective. In addition, These connectors are optimized for delegated accounts, allowing you to hold your funds in a primary account (portfolio or granter account) while signing trades and transactions with a separate trading account. The advantage? You can run multiple Hummingbot instances using the same pool of funds but different trading accounts, thus avoiding sequence number conflicts.

See the [Injective](/exchanges/injective) documentation for more information.
