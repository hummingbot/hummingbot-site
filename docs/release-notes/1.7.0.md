## New Exchange Certification Program

We introduce a new program that [certifies](/maintenance/certification) certain exchanges in the Hummingbot codebase, selected via a [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/hbot.eth/proposal/0x1f84875fb764d697a106e07fa5a7b6584a418cf5634aa94f4d9a8c5852455f4e) by the Hummingbot community. This allows the Foundation to support these exchange connectors better via bug bounties and improvement bounties, as well as partner with these exchanges to promote usage of their connectors.
