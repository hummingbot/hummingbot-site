# Release Notes - Version 1.18.0

*Released on July 24, 2023*

We are very excited to ship the July 2023 release of Hummingbot (v1.18.0) today! This release features a significant upgrade to **Python 3.10**, providing enhanced performance and reliability for users. In Gateway, the **Uniswap** connector now supports fetching prices directly from pools, which lowers latency and resolves past issues. In addition, we added Candles Feeds and Market Orders support to the **Ascendex** connector, as well as a new DEX connector to **Vertex**!

!!! warning "Ongoing Gateway issue"
    When running Gateway, if you encounter the following error message, `Price query failed: Token not supported`, a simultaneous restart of both the Gateway and client should fix the issue. For updates on this issue, see [#164](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/issues/164).

## Monthly Community Call

Each month, we livestream a community call on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/hummingbot) server that highlights the new features included in each release:

## Python 3.10 Upgrade

[#6389](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6389) upgrades Hummingbot's Python version to 3.10 and updates its most important dependencies. This upgrade improves the client's performance, reliability, and security. It also allows users who install from source to utilize the latest version of Anaconda and Miniconda and enables support for the Apple M2 chipset.

## Refactored Chain Endpoints

[#147](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/pull/147) and [#6445](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6445) refactored the Gateway route structure to standardize  endpoints to use  `/chain` rather than blockchain-specific endpoints. This enables Gateway to scale the number of chains it can support without introducing bloat.

All chains should now utilize the following routes:

```
/chain/allowances
/chain/cancel
/chain/approve
/chain/nonce
/chain/tokens
/chain/balances
/chain/poll
/chain/transfer
/chain/status
/chain/config
```

## Uniswap Direct Pool Interaction

The initial design of the Uniswap connector utilizes its `smart order router` to price and route swaps, but users have reported latency issues with the router. [#136](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/pull/136) and [#153](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/pull/153) added the ability to use the [QuoterV2](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/periphery/lens/QuoterV2) rather than the router.

This introduces two additional parameters defined in the `uniswap.yml` config file:

* useRouter (bool, default=true): if True, estimation and execution functions use the Router; if false, use quote and trade functions of SDK.
* feeTier (string, default='MEDIUM'): Matches one of the Uniswap fee tier strings. If useRouter is False, then the user has to specify feeTier to find the right pool.

**Thanks to [VPashkov](https://github.com/VPashkov) for this fix! 🙏**

## AscendEx Candles Feed and Market Orders Support

This release adds additional features for Ascendex, which the community used HBOT governance to prioritze as a Silver-tier connector for Epoch 4.

[Candles Feed](../v2-strategies/candles-feed.md) helps you generate custom OHLCV candles using both historical and live Websocket data, and create real-time custom technical indicators using `pandas_ta`. We have added support for `ascendex`:

```python
candles = [CandlesFactory.get_candle(connector="ascendex",
           trading_pair="ETH-USDT", interval="1m", max_records=100)]
```

Following our [Technical Roadmap](https://blog.hummingbot.org/technical-roadmap-2023/), we are expanding our connectors to support to include all order types offered by an exchange. In this release, we integrated the `market_order` type for [Ascendex](/exchanges/ascendex).

**Pull Requests:** [#6418](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6418), [#6471](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6471)

**Thanks to [yancong001](https://github.com/yancong001) for this contribution! 🙏**

## New DEX Connector: Vertex

[Vertex](https://vertexprotocol.com/)  is a fully decentralized peer-to-peer orderbook-based cryptocurrency exchange for the DeFi ecosystem built on Substrate.

See [Vertex](/exchanges/vertex) for the exchange connector docs.

**Pull Requests:** [#6379](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6379)

**Snapshot Proposal:** https://snapshot.org/#/hbot-prp.eth/proposal/0x68a4b91e9461266b32ad16e8a78219df04623ad529cf63ac109499e18317b661

## Hummingbot Dashboard Updates

[Hummingbot Dashboard](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard) is a **community-driven project** to build a **control center** for Hummingbot instances.

We hold bi-weekly calls in the Hummingbot Discord to discuss Dashboard:

While Dashboard is a new, highly experimental project, we encourage users to try it out and provide feedback on the **##dashboard** channel in Discord. For more information, see the [Task Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/hummingbot/projects/14) as well as the [Wiki](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard/wiki) where you can see the current tasks being worked on as well as the contributors assigned.

## New Script Examples

This release adds a couple directional strategies including a script example to test the newly added DEX data feed.

- [amm_data_feed_example.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/amm_data_feed_example.py): This is a script example using two DEX data feeds of different networks. **Pull Request:** [#6477](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6477)

- [directional_strategy_trend_follower.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/directional_strategy_trend_follower.py): This is a trend following strategy. **Pull Request:** [#6415](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6415)

- [directional_strategy_widening_ema_bands.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/directional_strategy_widening_ema_bands.py): This strategy uses two EMAs one short and one long to generate trading signals and execute trades based on the percentage of distance between them. **Pull Request:** [#6390](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6390)
