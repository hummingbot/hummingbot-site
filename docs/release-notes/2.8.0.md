## Release Highlights

### 🔗 Gateway 2.8.0 - Major Architecture Refactor

This release completes the [NCP-22](https://snapshot.box/#/s:hbot-ncp.eth/proposal/0xce92e088bb088e66e17f6c26b07643f1dcb3c0e57c8d3e93b80e37e6c92e7ebf) Gateway refactor, introducing a completely revamped architecture with standardized schemas, native Gateway commands in Hummingbot, and modernized DEX connectors.

#### 🏗️ Architecture Overhaul

**Standardized Schemas**: Implemented three universal trading schemas across all DEX connectors:

  - [**Router Schema**](/gateway/connectors#router-schema): DEX aggregators (Jupiter, 0x, Uniswap Router) that find optimal swap routes
  - [**AMM Schema**](/gateway/connectors#amm-schema): Traditional V2-style constant product pools (Raydium AMM, Uniswap V2)
  - [**CLMM Schema**](/gateway/connectors#clmm-schema): V3-style concentrated liquidity pools (Meteora DLMM, Raydium CLMM, Uniswap V3)

**New Configuration System**: 

  - Token lists now stored in `/conf/tokens/{chain}/{network}.json` following [tokenlists.org](https://tokenlists.org/) standard
  - Pool definitions in `/conf/pools/{connector}.json` for each DEX
  - Network-specific YAML files for chain configurations
  - See [Configuration Guide](/gateway/configuration) for details

#### 🎮 Gateway Commands in Hummingbot

Added comprehensive [Gateway commands](/gateway/commands) directly in the Hummingbot client:

* **Wallet Management**: `gateway connect`, `gateway balance` - Connect wallets and check balances
* **Trading**: `gateway swap` - Execute swaps with quotes and slippage protection
* **Liquidity**: `gateway lp` - Manage AMM and CLMM liquidity positions
* **Configuration**: `gateway token`, `gateway pool`, `gateway config` - Manage tokens, pools, and settings
* **Monitoring**: `gateway ping`, `gateway list` - Check connection status and available connectors

#### 🔄 Revamped DEX Connectors

* **[Jupiter](/exchanges/gateway/jupiter)**: Complete rewrite with Router schema, improved route finding and error handling
* **[Meteora](/exchanges/gateway/meteora)**: New DLMM (Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker) support with CLMM schema
* **[Raydium](/exchanges/gateway/raydium)**: Dual support for AMM V2 pools and CLMM V3 concentrated liquidity
* **[Uniswap](/exchanges/gateway/uniswap)**: Migrated to Universal Router with support for V2 AMM, V3 CLMM, and Smart Order Router

#### 🛠️ Legacy Connector Updates

Standardized existing Gateway connectors to align with the new architecture. The following connectors are ready for v2.8.0 schema implementation with bounties available:

* **[PancakeSwap](/exchanges/gateway/pancakeswap)** - BNB Chain AMM/CLMM ([Bounty #7654](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/issues/7654))
* **[Balancer](/exchanges/gateway/balancer)** - Multi-asset AMM pools ([Bounty #7653](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/issues/7653))
* **[Curve](/exchanges/gateway/curve)** - Stablecoin-optimized AMM ([Bounty #7652](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/issues/7652))
* **[SushiSwap](/exchanges/gateway/sushiswap)** - Multi-chain AMM/CLMM
* **[QuickSwap](/exchanges/gateway/quickswap)** - Polygon AMM/CLMM
* **[TraderJoe](/exchanges/gateway/traderjoe)** - Avalanche AMM/CLMM
* **[ETCSwap](/exchanges/gateway/etcSwap)** - Ethereum Classic AMM

See the [DEX Connectors](/gateway/connectors) page for full details on upgrading these connectors to the v2.8.0 standard. 

#### 🔐 Security & Infrastructure

* **Hardware Wallet Support**: Full Ledger integration for Ethereum and Solana chains
* **Transaction Safety**: Added simulation, connector-specific settings, and slippage protection
* **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and recovery mechanisms across all connectors
* **Integration**: Transaction handling and data storage in Hummingbot

#### 📚 Documentation & Developer Experience

* **Swagger API**: Enhanced API documentation available at `http://localhost:15888/docs` in DEV mode
* **[Gateway Documentation](/gateway)**: Complete rewrite with practical guides and examples
* **[Gateway Strategies](/gateway/strategies)**: New scripts demonstrating AMM Data Feed, AMM Trade, and LP Position Management
* **[Chain Schemas](/gateway/chains#chain-schema)**: Standardized request/response schemas for all blockchain operations

#### 🚀 Migration Guide

For users upgrading from Gateway v2.7 or earlier, see the [Gateway Installation Guide](/gateway/installation) for complete setup instructions.

### 🤖 Hummingbot MCP Server

We introduced the **Hummingbot MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server**, a new server module that connects Hummingbot with AI agents, automation frameworks, and external tools via the [MCP standard](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol).

Key highlights:

* **AI-Powered Control**: Exposed bot and strategy management through MCP-compatible clients (e.g., Claude, Gemini, Cursor).
* **API Integration**: Acted as a middleware layer between the Hummingbot API and AI/automation clients.
* **Docker Deployment**: Added official Docker images for fast setup.
