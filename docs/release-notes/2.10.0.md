docker compose down
docker pull hummingbot/hummingbot:latest
docker compose up -d
```

### Source

Update the branches of each repo to this release by running:
```bash
git pull origin master # Hummingbot

Afterwards, follow the instructions to re-install dependencies and compile the codebase for each repository. See [Install Hummingbot from Source](/installation/linux/) and [Install Gateway from Source](/gateway/installation).

## Release Highlights

### ✨ Multi-Server Support for Hummingbot MCP

We’ve expanded the **Hummingbot MCP** server to support **multiple API servers** and streamlined configuration to make AI-driven orchestration more powerful and user-friendly.

**Key Updates**

* **Simplified Setup:** Removed the mandatory `HUMMINGBOT_API_URL` requirement — start the MCP server without predefining a single API instance.

* **Multi-Server Management:** Add, switch, and manage multiple Hummingbot API instances (local or remote) from a single interface.

* **Persistent Storage:** Server configurations and credentials are now stored in a dedicated volume for long-term persistence across sessions.

This enhancement enables traders to manage multiple Hummingbot deployments from a single AI interface, manage different trading strategies across separate workspaces, or monitor multiple bot instances without reconfiguring the MCP client. The flexible architecture supports both local testing and remote production servers, streamlining workflows for traders running complex, multi-instance operations.

### 🔄 Bitget Connector Updates (Spot + Perpetual)

We’ve introduced a **new Bitget Spot connector** and refactored the **Perpetual connector** to align with Bitget’s latest API specifications.

This work was part of a [bounty](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/issues/7763) supported by the Bitget team.

**Highlights**

- **New Spot Connector:** Full integration for Bitget Spot trading.

- **Perpetual Refactor:** Migrated to the newest API endpoints for improved reliability.

- **Candles Feed Support:** Added candle feeds for both Spot and Perpetual markets ([#7794](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7794)).

- **Broker Code Integration:** Enabled broker code functionality ([#7822](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7822)).


These updates provide better performance, stability, and feature parity with Bitget’s production systems.

### 🔗 Gateway × Hummingbot API Integration

In [#89](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot-api/pull/89), we integrated **Gateway** directly with the **Hummingbot API**, creating a unified control plane for both centralized and decentralized exchange operations.

**Key Features**

- **Lifecycle Management:** Start and stop Gateway instances via MCP.

- **Blockchain Queries:** Retrieve on-chain balances and wallet data through standardized endpoints.

- **DEX Swaps:** Execute swaps on supported decentralized exchanges through the API.

- **Unified Interface:** Control both CEX and DEX trading layers through a single REST and MCP interface.

This integration bridges the Python-based Hummingbot API and TypeScript-based Gateway middleware, providing a seamless workflow for AI-assisted trading automation and portfolio management.

### 🛠️ Gateway Infrastructure Improvements

We’ve rolled out extensive Gateway upgrades spanning RPC handling, pool storage, and connector support across multiple networks.

**Highlights**

- **RPC Provider System:**
  Introduced flexible provider abstraction with integrations for **Helius (Solana)** and **Infura (EVM networks)**, offering regional endpoints, Jito support, and dynamic command updates via `gateway config <provider> update`.

- **Enhanced Pool Storage:**
  Migrated pool data structures to include canonical on-chain token addresses and fees, improving validation and data accuracy across 50 + pools (Raydium, Meteora, Uniswap, PancakeSwap).

- **PancakeSwap Solana CLMM:**
  Added complete support for concentrated-liquidity positions — including add/remove liquidity, collect fees, and WSOL wrapping — with full Token-2022 NFT compatibility.

- **EIP-1559 Gas Controls:**
  Introduced configuration for `maxFeePerGas`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, and `baseFeeMultiplier`, enabling both fixed and dynamic gas pricing strategies with Etherscan integration.

- **Client Integration:**
  Updated Hummingbot commands and schemas to align with the new pool structure (`baseTokenAddress`, `quoteTokenAddress`, `feePct`).

Collectively, these changes make Gateway more robust, modular, and transparent — paving the way for cross-chain liquidity management and advanced AMM strategies.
