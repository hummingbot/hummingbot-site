!!! note
    Other Hummingbot repositories such as [Hummingbot-API](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot-api), [Hummingbot MCP](https://github.com/hummingbot/mcp), and [Quants-Lab](https://github.com/hummingbot/quant-lab) follow a continuous deployment model without fixed version releases. Use the `main` branch for these repositories.

## How to Install and Update

### Docker - Hummingbot API (Recommended)

To install or update, run the [Hummingbot API](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot-api) setup script:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot-api.git
cd hummingbot-api
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

!!! warning "Deploy repo deprecated"
    The [Deploy](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy) repository is being deprecated in favor of the Hummingbot API installation process above, which helps you set up MCP, Dashboard, and other ways to interact with the API.

### Connect Your AI Assistant

```bash
# Hummingbot
docker compose down
docker pull hummingbot/hummingbot:latest
docker compose up -d
```

### Installation from Source

Update the branches of each repo to this release by running:
```bash
# Hummingbot
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot.git
cd hummingbot
git pull origin master

# Gateway
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot.git
cd gateway
git pull origin main
```

Afterwards, follow the instructions to re-install dependencies and compile the codebase for each repository. See [Install Hummingbot from Source](/installation/linux/) and [Install Gateway from Source](/gateway/installation).

## Release Highlights

### 🔗 Gateway × Hummingbot API Integration

In [#89](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot-api/pull/89), we integrated **Gateway** directly with the **Hummingbot API**, creating a unified control plane for both centralized and decentralized exchange operations.

**Key Features**

- **Lifecycle Management:** Start and stop Gateway instances via API and MCP
- **Blockchain Queries:** Retrieve on-chain balances and wallet data through standardized endpoints
- **DEX Swaps:** Execute swaps on supported decentralized exchanges through the API
- **Unified Interface:** Control both CEX and DEX trading layers through a single REST and MCP interface

This integration bridges the Python-based Hummingbot API and TypeScript-based Gateway middleware, providing a seamless workflow for AI-assisted trading automation and portfolio management across all supported blockchains and exchanges.

### ✨ Enhanced MCP Capabilities

We've significantly upgraded the **Hummingbot MCP** server to support **multi-server management** and **Gateway integration**, making AI-driven orchestration more powerful and flexible.

**Multi-Server Support**

* **Simplified Setup:** Removed the mandatory `HUMMINGBOT_API_URL` requirement — start the MCP server without predefining a single API instance
* **Multi-Server Management:** Add, switch, and manage multiple Hummingbot API instances (local or remote) from a single interface
* **Persistent Storage:** Server configurations and credentials are now stored in a dedicated volume for long-term persistence across sessions

**Gateway Integration via MCP**

* **Unified Control:** Manage both Hummingbot API and Gateway instances through the same MCP interface
* **Cross-Chain Operations:** Execute CEX and DEX operations seamlessly through natural language commands
* **AI-Driven Workflow:** Enable Claude and other AI assistants to orchestrate complex multi-chain trading strategies

This enhancement enables traders to manage multiple Hummingbot deployments from a single AI interface, coordinate strategies across CEX and DEX venues, and monitor multiple bot instances without reconfiguring the MCP client. The flexible architecture supports both local testing and remote production servers, streamlining workflows for traders running complex, multi-instance operations.

### 🔄 Bitget Connector Updates (Spot + Perpetual)

We've introduced a **new Bitget Spot connector** and refactored the **Perpetual connector** to align with Bitget's latest API specifications, strengthening our partnership with [Bitget](https://www.bitget.com/blog/articles/bitget-expands-partnership-hummingbot).

This connector was developed through our [connector bounties program](/bounties/), which enables exchanges to integrate with Hummingbot through a transparent, community-driven process. The bounty was funded by Bitget and executed by talented developers from our community.

**Highlights**

- **New Spot Connector:** Full integration for Bitget Spot trading.

- **Perpetual Refactor:** Migrated to the newest API endpoints for improved reliability.

- **Candles Feed Support:** Added candle feeds for both Spot and Perpetual markets ([#7794](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7794)).

- **Broker Code Integration:** Enabled broker code functionality ([#7822](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7822)).


These updates provide better performance, stability, and feature parity with Bitget’s production systems.

**Special thanks to [gtwototoo](https://github.com/gtwototoo) for this contribution! 🙏**

### 🥞 PancakeSwap Solana CLMM Connector

We've added complete support for **PancakeSwap on Solana**, bringing concentrated liquidity market making to Solana's fastest-growing DEX.

**Key Features**

- **Full CLMM Support:** Open/close positions, add/remove liquidity, and collect fees on PancakeSwap V3 pools
- **WSOL Wrapping:** Automatic SOL ↔ WSOL conversion for seamless trading
- **Token-2022 Compatible:** Full support for Solana's new token standard and NFT position tracking
- **Native Solana Integration:** Built on Solana's high-performance blockchain infrastructure

PancakeSwap Solana leverages the same concentrated liquidity mechanics as PancakeSwap V3 on EVM chains, now optimized for Solana's speed and low transaction costs. This integration enables sophisticated market making strategies on Solana's most liquid trading pairs.

### 🛠️ Gateway Infrastructure Improvements

We’ve rolled out additional upgrades to the recently refactored [Gateway](/gateway) DEX middleware, spanning RPC handling, pool storage, and connector support across multiple networks.

**Highlights**

- **RPC Provider System:**
  Introduced flexible provider abstraction with integrations for **Helius (Solana)** and **Infura (EVM networks)**, offering regional endpoints, Jito support, and dynamic command updates via `gateway config <provider> update`.

- **Enhanced Pool Storage:**
  Migrated pool data structures to include canonical on-chain token addresses and fees, improving validation and data accuracy across 50 + pools (Raydium, Meteora, Uniswap, PancakeSwap).

- **EIP-1559 Gas Controls:**
  Introduced configuration for `maxFeePerGas`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, and `baseFeeMultiplier`, enabling both fixed and dynamic gas pricing strategies with Etherscan integration.

- **Client Integration:**
  Updated Hummingbot commands and schemas to align with the new pool structure (`baseTokenAddress`, `quoteTokenAddress`, `feePct`).

Collectively, these changes make Gateway more robust, modular, and transparent — paving the way for cross-chain liquidity management and advanced AMM strategies.
