## Order Level Builder

In [#6615](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6615), we are excited to announce the integration of the `Order Level Builder` into Hummingbot. This new feature allows users to create and manage order distributions with enhanced precision and flexibility, catering to a wide range of trading strategies.

The Order Level Builder introduces several distribution types, including `Linear`, `Arithmetic`, `Geometric`, and `Logarithmic`, each designed to meet different strategic needs. Users can now set parameters such as `start_spread`, `end_spread`, `n_levels`, and others depending on the chosen distribution type. This offers a tailored approach to order placement, allowing traders to optimize their strategies according to market conditions and personal preferences.

For more information check the [Order Levels](../v2-strategies/order-levels/index.md) documentation.
