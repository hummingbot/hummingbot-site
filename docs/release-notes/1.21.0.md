## Introduction

We're thrilled to present Hummingbot version 1.21.0! This version introduces a new 9-step Intro to Dashboard quickstart guide, along with a new authentication module in Dashboard. It also features a smoother and faster startup process due to the refactored trading pair fetcher, along with a significant Dexalot connector fix!

## New Quickstart Guide: Intro to Dashboard

We're thrilled to introduce a new Quickstart guide that shows users how to set up and use Dashboard. While it's still under active development, we expect Dashboard to become the main entry point for new Hummingbot users in the future. 

See [Quickstart - Intro to Dashboard](../academy-content/posts/quickstart-dashboard/0-index.md) or watch the first video below:

## New Dashboard Features

!!! warning "Under Active Development"
    Dashboard is slated for incorporation into official Hummingbot releases before end of this year, but it is still under active development and new features and improvements are being added continuously. We highly encourage user feedback at this stage; feel free to share your thoughts and suggestions on Discord or Github. If you're excited to explore its capabilities, check out the [beta](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard).

### Authentication Module

This release implemented authentication functionality within the Streamlit framework, which lets you require users to login to access any page in Dashboard, thereby enhancing security. This authentication can be enabled / disabled depending on user preference. 

See [Setting up Dashboard](../academy-content/posts/quickstart-dashboard/2-manage-credentials.md) in the Intro to Dashboard guide.

- [#71](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard/pull/71) added the initial authentication module
- [#86](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard/pull/86) made the system configurable
- [#88](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard/pull/88) added a helper script to assist with authentication processes

### V2 Strategy Framework Improvements

- **Base Controllers and Master Script Addition**: [#74](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard/pull/74) Added foundational controllers and a master script for better script management.
- **Improve Create Controllers Page**: [#78](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard/pull/78) Revamped the page for creating controllers for a better user experience.

### Misc

- **Text Wrapper for Queries**: [#72](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard/pull/72) Introduced a text wrapper to improve query handling. **Thanks to [tomasgaudino](https://github.com/tomasgaudino) for this contribution! üôè**

## Refactored Trading Pair Fetcher

In [#6526](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6526), Hummingbot no longer fetches trading pairs from all connectors at startup. Instead, by default it will only fetch pairs from exchanges where the user has added API keys, as well as the [Paper Trade](/global-configs/paper-trade/) exchanges, defined in `conf_client.yml`.

This should result in a faster startup process, plus fewer errors in the log from geo-restricted connectors.

There is a new configuration variable `fetch_pairs_from_all_exchanges` in `conf_client.yml`, which is set to `False` by default. If the variable is `True`, pairs are fetched from all exchange connectors, maintaining the previous behavior.

## Removed Connectors due to Governance

Per the [Epoch 6](../blog/posts/2023-10-epoch-6-polls-recap/index.md) quarterly Poll results, not all connectors received enough community support to reach the 200,000 HBOT Connector Inclusion Threshold, and they will be removed during Q4 2023.
