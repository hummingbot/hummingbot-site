## Hummingbot 2.0.1 Highlights

### dYdX Updated Installation Instructions

The new **dYdX** API connector has been upgraded to v4 in this release, enabling users to run bots on one of the leading decentralized perpetual DEXs! Due to dependency conflicts, we have created a custom Docker image and custom scripts to help users install Hummingbot with dYdX. The complete install instructions can be found in the [dYdX connector docs](../exchanges/dydx.md), and see the blog post announcing the new dYdX sponsorship [here](/blog/announcing-the-new-dydx-v4-connector-in-hummingbot/)!

### Dashboard Authentication

We‚Äôve reintroduced the authentication feature in this release, providing an additional layer of security for users who share their dashboard with others, such as team members or collaborators. 

Authentication is disabled by default. However, if you want to enable it, please follow the instructions provided for your specific setup: **[Docker](../installation/hummingbot-deploy/quickstart.md#docker)** | **[Source](../installation/hummingbot-deploy/quickstart.md#source)**.
