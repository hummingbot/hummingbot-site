## Release Highlights

### Ongoing Refactor of Gateway DEX Connectors

With the continuous evolution of decentralized trading on Solana, this release introduces new connectors for Raydium CLMM and AMM routes in Gateway, as well as Meteora and Raydium Solana DEX connectors. This marks a significant step towards standardizing request and response interfaces for Swap, CLMM, and AMM endpoints, which will serve as the blueprint for future DEX connectors.

Following the Gateway improvements in `2.3.0`, this release refines the connector architecture by making each route modular. This allows for better flexibility and a more maintainable structure, simplifying the addition of new DEXs like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and Trader Joe in future iterations. Raydium CLMM and Meteora connectors now serve as reference implementations for concentrated liquidity market making (CLMM).

The next release (2.5.0) will introduce sample strategies leveraging the new CLMM and AMM connectors, showcasing how traders can build effective strategies using these new components.

Check out the video demo on how to automate Meteora LP positions in Hummingbot with a script that dynamically opens, monitors, and closes positions based on price movements.

### Environment Upgrade / Improved Tests

This release introduces significant updates to modernize the Hummingbot environment and improve its performance and maintainability. It replaces the outdated `Nose` test framework with `Pytest`, removes a hacky Telegram integration along with other unnecessary dependencies, and upgrades important libraries like Pydantic for faster performance. Collectively, these changes streamline dependency management, provide a more robust and modern testing suite, and make the codebase leaner and easier to maintain.

### New Derive Spot and Perpetual Connector

This release adds support for a Derive perpetual connector in [Hummingbot #7432](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7432) enabling users to trade on `derive.xyz` through Hummingbot with the [bounty](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/issues/7344), funded by the Derive team. Initially, the bounty was just for the `perpetual` connector but developer also added the `spot connector` as well in [Hummingbot #7383](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7383). See the [Derive](../exchanges/derive/index.md) documentation for more information.
