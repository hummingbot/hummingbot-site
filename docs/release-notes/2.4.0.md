## Release Highlights

### Ongoing Refactor of Gateway DEX Connectors

With the continuous refactor of Gateway approved in [NCP-22](https://snapshot.box/#/s:hbot-ncp.eth/proposal/0x5cc3540ee219787d5c842bc1ccdb11aab46203bb7f0be658b6b40858501a8e4c), this release introduces new connectors for Raydium CLMM and AMM markets, as well as standardized request and response interfaces for CLMM, AMM, and Swap functionality in Gateway.  This marks a significant step towards a flexible yet standardized blueprint for future DEX connectors.

The next release (2.5.0) will begin modifying the Hummingbot client to take advantage of the new CLMM and AMM connectors in Gateway, including sample Hummingbot scripts leveraging that showcase how traders can build effective strategies using these new components. As a preview, check out the video demo below for a Hummingbot script that automate Meteora LP positions by dynamically opens, monitors, and closes positions based on user-defined parameters.

### Core Environment Upgrade and Tests

This release introduces significant updates to modernize the Hummingbot environment and improve its performance and maintainability. It replaces the outdated `nose` test framework with `pytest`, removes the legacy, deprecated Telegram integration in preparation for an forthcoming update, and upgrades important libraries like Pydantic for faster performance. Collectively, these changes streamline dependency management, provide a more robust and modern testing suite, and make the codebase leaner and easier to maintain.

### New Derive Spot and Perpetual Connector

This release adds support for spot and perpetual connectors to [Derive](https://www.derive.xyz/), a decentralized CLOB trading protocol. See pull request [Hummingbot #7432](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7432) which was supported by a [bounty](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/issues/7344) funded by the Derive team. 

While the bounty was just for the CLOB perpetual connector, the developer also generously added the CLO spot connector in [Hummingbot #7383](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7383). **Thanks to [isreallee82](https://github.com/isreallee82) for this contribution! üôè**

See the [Derive](../exchanges/derive/index.md) documentation for more information.
