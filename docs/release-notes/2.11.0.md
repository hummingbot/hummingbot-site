### 🐳 New Orca Connector for Solana DEX Trading

We’re excited to introduce a **brand-new Orca connector**, bringing one of Solana’s most popular DEXs into the Hummingbot ecosystem. This integration enables traders to execute swaps and liquidity-sensitive strategies on Solana using Hummingbot’s unified API.

This connector was developed through our **[connector bounties program](../bounties/index.md)**, which empowers community developers and ecosystem partners to build high-quality integrations in an open and transparent process.

**Highlights**

* **Seamless Orca Integration:** Full support for interacting with Orca’s Whirlpool AMM and swap functionality.
* **Solana Native Support:** Utilizes Solana-specific transaction building, signing, and routing logic for fast, reliable execution.
* **DEX-Focused Architecture:** Designed to work across Orca pools, enabling market-making, arbitrage, and custom strategy development.
* **Gateway Compatibility:** Fully accessible through Gateway, making it easy to use via the Hummingbot UI or external workflows.

This new connector expands Hummingbot’s cross-chain DEX capabilities and strengthens our support for high-performance Solana-based trading.

### 🛠️ Gateway Connector & Infrastructure Enhancements

This release delivers a wide set of improvements across Gateway’s Solana and EVM connectors, focusing on **token reliability**, **pool discovery**, **error-handling consistency**, and **CLMM stability**. Together, these updates strengthen cross-chain LP workflows, improve swap accuracy, and make Gateway more resilient to real-world RPC/provider quirks.

**Highlights**

* **Dynamic & Robust Token Handling** [#543](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/pull/543)
  Gateway now supports **unlisted ERC-20 tokens**, dynamic wrapped-token detection, and graceful fallbacks when external RPCs (like Helius) return mixed parsed/base64 formats. This resolves issues in Polygon wrapping, BigInt conversions, and post-transaction balance extraction.

* **CLMM Stability Improvements (Meteora, Raydium, Orca, PancakeSwap-Sol)** [#550](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/pull/550)
  Added fixes for **InvalidPositionWidth** errors, accurate Meteora fee reporting, improved user-facing swap/allowance errors, and reliable handling of unknown pool tokens. CLMM operations across Solana ecosystems now behave consistently and predictably.

* **WebSocket Monitoring & Real-Time Discovery Tools** [#555](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/pull/555)
  Introduced **Helius and Infura WebSocket listeners** for live transaction monitoring, plus **CoinGecko-based token & pool discovery** with automatic caching. This enhances ecosystem coverage and allows instant visibility into new tokens and pool opportunities.

* **Standardized Error Handling Framework** [#563](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/pull/563) [#564](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/pull/564)
  A new centralized `HttpError` service standardizes error messages and HTTP responses across ~70 connector routes, improving clarity and debugging consistency for all Solana and EVM connectors.

* **Expanded DEX & Provider Compatibility** [#569](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/pull/569)
  Added GeckoTerminal DEX mappings for Uniswap V3 on major EVM networks, upgraded Meteora SDK, improved PancakeSwap-Sol parser resilience, migrated Jupiter to its new API, and unified all external service keys (Helius, Infura, CoinGecko, Etherscan) under a shared config model. 


### 🔐 Hyperliquid API Key Authentication Now Supported

Hummingbot now supports **API key–based authentication** for both the **Hyperliquid Spot** and **Hyperliquid Perpetual** connectors, offering a more flexible alternative to the existing Arbitrum wallet + private key setup.

With this enhancement, traders can generate API key/secret credentials directly from the **Hyperliquid web interface** and use them to place orders, manage positions, and run automated strategies through Hummingbot.

**Highlights**

* **Dual Authentication Modes:** Choose between API key authentication or Arbitrum wallet signing, depending on your workflow and security preferences.
* **Spot + Perpetual Coverage:** Unified API key support across both `hyperliquid` (spot) and `hyperliquid_perpetual` (perp) connectors.
* **Simplified Setup:** Configure your API credentials directly in Hummingbot without needing an on-chain private key.

This update streamlines the onboarding experience for Hyperliquid users and enhances compatibility with a broader range of trading setups.
