### üß∞ Hummingbot API Client

We introduce a modern, asynchronous Python client for interacting with the new Hummingbot API. Designed with modular router support to simplify integration with trading, portfolio, and bot management endpoints.

- Built for developers creating custom tools, dashboards, and automation workflows.

- Used as the interface layer in Hummingbot Dashboard v2.7.0.

üìö Documentation: See examples in the [API Quickstart Guide](/hummingbot-api/quickstart/)


### üìä Dashboard Update

Hummingbot Dashboard has been completely rebuilt to use the new Hummingbot API using the API Client, providing:

* **Enhanced Performance**: Faster load times and more responsive UI through the new API architecture

* **Improved Reliability**: Better error handling and connection management

* **Unified Backend**: All operations now go through the standardized Hummingbot API

* **Future-Ready**: Foundation for upcoming features like multi-user support and advanced portfolio analytics

All dashboard pages have been updated to work with the new architecture. Documentation updates for each page coming soon.

### üß† Headless Mode

Run Hummingbot without the graphical user interface (GUI), reducing memory usage by up to **40%**. This lightweight mode enables you to deploy and manage more bots on resource-constrained environments, such as VPS or cloud instances.

To run in headless mode, use the quickstart script with the `--headless` flag:
```bash
bin/hummingbot_quickstart.py --headless -p PASSWORD -f CONFIG_FILE_NAME [-c SCRIPT_CONFIG]
```

Where:

- `--headless`: Enables headless mode
- `-p PASSWORD`: Your Hummingbot password
- `-f CONFIG_FILE_NAME`: Strategy config file (.yml) or script file (.py)
- `-c SCRIPT_CONFIG`: (Optional) Configuration file for scripts
