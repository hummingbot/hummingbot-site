# Hummingbot v1.25.0 Release Notes

*Released on February 26, 2024*

## Introduction

We're thrilled to unveil Hummingbot version 1.25.0, featuring the new **DEX** connector **CarbonDeFi** and enhanced market data through candles feed for **OKX perpetuals** and **Kraken**. These updates not only expand our DeFi trading capabilities but also provide users with deeper market insights for more strategic trading decisions. 

A notable area of improvement in this release is the bug fixes and enhancements for the **XRPL connector**. Our team has dedicated considerable effort to ensuring a smoother and more reliable trading experience on the **Ripple Ledger**

Lastly, we've undertaken a huge refactor to the **v2 strategies framework**. This overhaul not only optimizes performance but also makes the framework more intuitive and flexible for strategy development. This change paves the way for advanced trading strategies and customization, empowering our users to tailor their trading approaches with greater precision.

## V2 Strategies framework refactor

This release introduces a comprehensive refactor of the [V2 Strategies](/v2-strategies) framework, building on the foundation laid by the introduction of the module of smart components last year. While these smart components have significantly enhanced our framework, there are areas identified for improvement that will substantially elevate the user experience. 

In addition, aside from the improvements made to the existing strategies we've also added a couple new sample strategies:

### DMan V5

The [**DManV5**](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/development/scripts/v2_dman_v5_with_config.py) strategy utilizes the MACD indicator to generate buy or sell signals, then applies a Dollar Cost Averaging approach to execute trades. It dynamically adjusts order amounts and spreads based on geometric distributions and manages executor actions based on the strategy's rules and market conditions. It includes mechanisms for taking profit, stopping losses, and employing a trailing stop to optimize trade outcomes.

### DMan V6

The [**DManV6**](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/development/scripts/v2_dman_v6_with_config.py) focuses on executing trades using a DCA approach, where orders are placed at different price levels and conditions based on the strategy's configuration. The strategy dynamically adjusts its actions based on market conditions, the status of existing orders, and predefined settings for managing trades. This includes leveraging technical indicators, order distribution strategies, and risk management tools like stop loss and take profit parameters.

## New DEX Connector: CarbonDeFi

[Carbon](https://www.carbondefi.xyz) is a decentralized trading protocol that enables users to execute advanced on-chain trading strategies in a non-custodial and fully on-chain manner. It offers features like automated limit orders, custom price range adjustments, and the ability to create "recurring strategies" for buying low and selling high within specified price ranges. 

Carbon's approach is designed to work efficiently, resembling a DEX trading bot, and is audited for safety, ensuring a secure trading environment for all users. For more detailed information, refer to the [Carbon](https://docs.carbondefi.xyz) connector docs.
