## New Quickstart Guide

Hummingbot has evolved from a simple market making bot into a framework that lets users define custom strategies that automate order book data collection and order execution across multiple crypto exchanges. 

To help users understand how to use Scripts to build custom strategies, the new [Quickstart Guide](/quickstart) teaches you how to build and customize a market making strategy over 5 exercises.

## Revamped Installation Section

We have streamlined and simplified the [Installation](/installation) section, adding OS-specific guides and [a new Docker page](/installation/docker) that explains how to deploy various Hummingbot configurations using Docker.

## New Doc Pages

This release introduced the following new documentation pages and sections:

- [Candles Feed](/scripts/candles-feed/): Custom OHLCV candles using both historical and live Websocket data
- [Cheatsheet](/scripts/cheatsheet/): Reference for creating Scripts
- [Smart Components](/scripts/smart-components/): Self-executing, encapsulated piece of logic like `PositionExecutor`
- [Orchestration Module](/installation/multiple-bots/#orchestration-module): Community-maintained repo for orchestrating multiple bots

## Orchestration Module: Phase 2

**Pull Request**: [#6113](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6113)

This PR implements the features of **Phase 2** for [HIP-Bot Orchestration](https://hummingbot-foundation.notion.site/Bot-Orchestration-fcac18bd90d74b0ebca9b260617522f0#1a435ce4e3b0410aa4a50295b91f22af).

It provides interfaces for subscribing to external topics and listening to messages through the `EEventQueueFactory`, `EEventListenerFactory`, `ETopicQueueFactory`, and `ETopicListenerFactory` classes. The specification defines a base URI format for consuming external events, and URI slashes are transformed to dots for multi-broker and multi-protocol support. Finally, this PR extends the global configuration and adds the mqtt_external_events parameter for globally enabling/disabling external events feature for bot instances.

See the [Orchestration Module](/installation/multiple-bots/#orchestration-module) documentation for more information.

## New Perpetual CEX Connector: `kucoin_perpetual`

**Pull Request:** [#6150](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6150)

Since Kucoin is a Silver connector maintained by Hummingbot Foundation,the Foundation allocates HBOT tokens to fund a bounty for a community developer to add a perpetual connector.

[Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com) is a centralized cryptocurrency exchange platform that was launched in 2017 and is based in Seychelles. The platform operates its own native token, Kucoin Shares (KCS), which provides users with various benefits such as reduced trading fees and a share of the platform's revenue. Kucoin has gained popularity among cryptocurrency traders due to its competitive trading fees, diverse range of digital assets, and innovative features.

See the [Kucoin Perpetual](/exchanges/kucoin-perpetual/) documentation for more information.

!!! note
    There may be some issues not yet identified outside our testing. If you run into a bug with the connector please report them on our [Github](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=) page

**Thanks to `ethicrypt` for this contribution! 🙏**

## New AMM DEX Connector and Chain: `xsswap` / `xdc-chain`

**Pull Requests:** [#6114](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6114), [#0045](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/pull/45)

[XDC](https://xdc.org/) is a public blockchain that aims to provide a fast and efficient infrastructure for decentralized applications and enterprise use cases. It is built on top of the Ethereum codebase and uses a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm to validate transactions and create new blocks.

See the [XDC Chain](/chains/xdc-chain) and [XSSwap](/exchanges/xswap) documentation for more information.

**Thanks to [CoinAlpha](https://github.com/coinalpha) for this contribution! 🙏**

## New CLOB DEX Connector: `dexalot`

**Pull Requests:** [#6153](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6153), [#0065](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/pull/65)

[Dexalot](https://dexalot.com/) is a revolutionary decentralized exchange aiming at bringing the traditional centralized exchange look and feel, through a decentralized on-chain application.  It is built on `Avalanche`, the fastest smart contracts platform in the blockchain industry.

See the [Dexalot](/exchanges/dexalot/) connector documentation for more information.

**Thanks to [CoinAlpha](https://github.com/coinalpha) for this contribution! 🙏**

## PositionExecutor Improvements

**Pull Request:** [#6135](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6135)

We improved the [PositionExecutor](/scripts/smart-components/#position-executor) Smart Component introduced in the last release:

* The first improvement is a minor change to the [`simple_directional_strategy_example`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/simple_directional_strategy_example.py) script, which involves setting the bounds of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) as described in the strategy. This change improves the accuracy of the strategy by ensuring that the RSI is calculated within the specified bounds.

* The second improvement is related to the reporting of the PositionExecutor. The update provides more detailed reporting by showing cumulative fees, profit and loss (PNL) in quote asset, and amount in both base and quote asset. This additional information provides users with a clear and concise view of their trading performance.

Overall, these improvements enhance the accuracy and transparency of the Simple directional strategy and provide more comprehensive reporting capabilities for the PositionExecutor, allowing users to make more informed trading decisions.

## `hedge` Strategy updates

**Pull Request:** [#6075](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6075)

* **Disable Auto Set Position:** In response to user feedback, we've added the ability to disable the auto set position feature on some exchanges, such as Bybit, that have experienced issues with this feature. You now have greater control over your position management.

* **Interval Logging:** We've also added interval logging to help you keep track of your Hedge Strategy performance. This will allow you to review your trading activity at a glance and make informed decisions going forward.

* **Active Orders Management:** To ensure that active orders are cancelled at the correct time, we've moved the check and cancel active orders function to the start of the tick. This improvement ensures that you're always trading with accurate information.

* **Timestamp Update:** We've made an update to the way timestamps are handled to prevent network and exchange errors from skipping the current hedge cycle. The last timestamp is now updated only at the end of the cycle, ensuring that your trades are executed as intended.
