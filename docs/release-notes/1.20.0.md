## V2 Strategy Framework

Hummingbot's V2 Strategy Framework is officially released!

The new [V2 Strategy Framework](/v2-strategies) significantly expands Hummingbot's capabilities, allowing users to create modular, backtestable, and sophisticated strategies. Unlike the monolithic V1 strategies, V2 Strategies are designed to be highly adaptable, allowing seamless integration of various components. Whether you're a technical expert or a trading novice, you can easily create, backtest, and deploy strategies via [Dashboard](/dashboard).

We're introducing specialized templates for different trading paradigms, starting with Directional and Market Making strategies. These new strategy templates allow users to combine different composable components:

* **Candles**: These structure both historical and real-time market data into OHLCV format, generating refined signals for trading decisions.
* **Controllers**: These orchestrate the overall strategy, deciding which Executors to deploy or adjust based on signals generated by Candles.
* **Executors**: These are the operational elements that handle precise trade execution, adapt to market changes, and manage the order lifecycle.

## New Dashboard Features

!!! warning "Under Active Development"
    Dashboard is slated for incorporation into official Hummingbot releases before end of this year, but it is still under active development and new features and improvements are being added continuously. We highly encourage user feedback at this stage; feel free to share your thoughts and suggestions on Discord or Github. If you're excited to explore its capabilities, check out the [beta](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard).

Additions to [Dashboard](/dashboard/) in the past month include:

- **Enhanced Strategy Performance**: [#68](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard/pull/68) revamped the Strategy Performance page, adding many charting and visualization components. **Thanks to [tomasgaudino](https://github.com/tomasgaudino) for this contribution! üôè**
- **Docker Error Fix**: [#64](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard/pull/64) fixed a bug with the Docker version of Dashboard.
- **Backtesting and Bot Deployment**: [#69](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard/pull/69) incorporated the Hummingbot Library, adapted backtesting engine to use it, saves configuration files for the trials selected, and allowed users for deploy instances with multiple saved controller configs.
- **Master Bot Credentials**: [#62](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard/pull/62) lets you use a single set of credentials to manage all your bot instances, streamlining the setup process.
- **Bot Status**: [#63](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard/pull/63) added a specialized parser that neatly formats the status of running bots, making it easier to monitor their activity.

## Hummingbot Library

We are excited to announce that Hummingbot is now available as a [Python library](https://pypi.org/project/hummingbot/), enabling more flexible usage and customization for developers!

To try it out, install the library into your Python environment with:

```
pip install hummingbot
```

After installation is complete, enter your Python shell and run these commands to fetch historical OHLVC candles for BTC-USDT on Binance Futures for the past 30 days into a `candles_test.csv` file:

```python
import asyncio

from hummingbot.data_feed.candles_feed.candles_factory import CandlesFactory, CandlesConfig

async def collect_candles():
    candles = CandlesFactory.get_candle(CandlesConfig(connector="binance_perpetual", trading_pair="BTC-USDT", interval="3m", max_records=1440))
    candles.start()
    while not candles.is_ready:
        print(f"Candles not ready yet! Missing {candles._candles.maxlen - len(candles._candles)}")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
    df = candles.candles_df
    df.to_csv("candles_test.csv", index=False)

asyncio.run(collect_candles())

```

**Pull Request:** [#6576](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6576)

## Update Cython version to 3.0

This upgrade not only brings in the latest features and bug fixes from Cython:

* Modified the environment.yml dependencies to upgrade Cython to the latest 3.0 version (to move out from the alpha version the project is currently depending on).

* Upgrading to the latest version allow Hummingbot to include all latest bugfixes. It will also allow the community to add the new functionality included in Cython 3.0 to generate a compiled Cythonized version of a pure Python module by just adding some Cython decorators to classes/functions.
