## Hummingbot 2.1.0 Highlights

### CEX Connector Improvements

- The `bybit_perpetual` connector has been upgraded to use the latest v5 API version, aligning it with the spot connector in [#7196](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7196).  **Thanks to [tomasgaudino](https://github.com/tomasgaudino) for this fix! üôè**

- Enhanced `coinbase_advanced_trade` connector with improved reliability and performance in [#7220](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7220). **Thanks to [isreallee82](https://github.com/isreallee82) for this contribution! üôè**

### V2 Framework Enhancements

Several core improvements have been made to the V2 Framework:

- Enhanced market data provider for better price feed accuracy [#7214](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7214)
- Improved candle feed boundaries handling for more reliable data fetching [#7224](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7224) **Thanks to [tomasgaudino](https://github.com/tomasgaudino) for this fix! üôè**
- Upgraded PositionExecutor component with increased max retries for better trade execution [#7244](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7244)

### Updated Dexalot Connector

This release introduces a fully Python-based implementation of the [Dexalot](/exchanges/dexalot) connector, removing the Gateway dependency in [#7219](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7219). Users can now:

- Connect directly using `connect dexalot` command
- Experience improved performance and stability
- Trade more efficiently with reduced latency

### New DEX Connectors

- We added support for [ETCSwap](/exchanges/etcSwap) on Ethereum Classic, expanding DEX trading options for users in [#340](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/pull/340).

- Based on approval from community voting, the [Tegro](/exchanges/tegro) exchange connector was added in [#7148](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7148).
