In this video, Fede demos a sneak peek at the new Bot Orchestration feature integrated into the Hummingbot dashboard that allows you to start and stop bots in addition to loading strategy or script files directly from the dashboard!

## Candle Improvements

This release includes several improvements and additions in handling candle data through a series of pull requests. `PR #6366` improved test mocking for candles by ensuring that a coroutine related to filling historical candles is properly mocked​. `PR #6345` added support for KuCoin spot candles following a structure similar to Binance and standardized interval management​​. `PR #6351` introduces support for Gate.io spot and perpetual candles, also following Binance's structure​​ while `PR #29` and `PR #6311` have added and improved features regarding the downloading of candle data.

**Pull Requests:** [#6345](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6345), [#6366](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6366), [#6351](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6351), [#29](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard/pull/29), [#6311](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6311)

## Market Data Collector

Hummingbot now has the functionality that allows for the collection of market data in the background from the markets that are initialized in the running strategy. The market data collection feature is added as a new config variable in the `conf_client.yml` file. Users can configure the following parameters:

- Enabled: Set to True/False to enable or disable market data collection.
- Interval: Specify the interval in seconds for collecting data (e.g. 60 seconds).
- Depth: Set the number of levels of the order book to collect (e.g. 20 levels).

The data collected includes `exchange`, `trading pair`, `timestamp`, `mid-price`, `best ask`, `best bid`, and `order book`. The data is stored in a new table in the sqlite DB called `MarketData`

**Pull Requests:** [#6364](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6364)
