# Release Notes - Version 1.17.0

*Released on June 26, 2023*

We are very excited to ship the June 2023 release of Hummingbot (v1.17.0) today!

This release simplifies the **Position Executor** class, making it easy to create custom directional strategies with Hummingbot. We also kicked off the new **Hummingbot Dashboard** community project and added a new **Data Collector** feature that collects and stores real-time market data as a bot runs!

For exchanges, we improved support for Silver-tier CEXs **Kucoin** and **Gate.io** by adding Candles Feeds and Market Orders support, as well as a new DEX connector to **Polkadex**!

## Position Executor

This release refactors the [Position Executor](../v2-strategies/candles-feed.md) smart component that creates self-executing [Triple Barrier](https://www.mlfinlab.com/en/latest/labeling/tb_meta_labeling.html) positions. Notably, this refactor integrates **both spot and perpetual support**, so that users can use the same component across both exchange types interchangeably.

Check out how few lines of code the sample directional scripts are now:

* [`directional_strategy_rsi_spot.py`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/development/scripts/directional_strategy_rsi_spot.py)
* [`directional_strategy_rsi.py`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/development/scripts/directional_strategy_rsi.py)

## Data Collector

![](/assets/img/market-data-table.png)

Hummingbot can now **collect real-time market data** in the background for the trading pairs that are initialized in the running strategy. Users can configure this feature by setting the new config variables in the `conf_client.yml` file:

- `market_data_collection_enabled`: Enable/disable the Market Data Collection feature.
- `market_data_collection_interval`: Set the market data collection interval in seconds (Default=60)
- `market_data_collection_depth`: Set the order book collection depth (Default=20)

The data is stored in a new SQLite DB table `MarketData` and includes:

- Exchange
- Trading Pair
- Timestamp
- Mid Price
- Best Ask
- Best Bid
- Order Book

## Hummingbot Dashboard

We are thrilled to announce the official launch of [Hummingbot Dashboard](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard), a **graphical control center** designed to facilitate the deployment and management of a fleet of Hummingbot instances.

Dashboard is an experiment **community project** that aims to actively involve the community from day 1 for bi-weekly meetings - we livestreamed the first one below:

## New Features for Kucoin and Gate.io

This release expands support for Kucoin and Gate.io, which the community used HBOT governance to prioritze as  Silver-tier connectors for Epoch 4.

[Candles Feed](../v2-strategies/candles-feed.md) helps you generate custom OHLCV candles using both historical and live Websocket data, and create real-time custom technical indicators using `pandas_ta`.

You can now use the following connectors:

- `kucoin`
- `gate_io`
- `gate_io_perpetual`

For example:
```python
candles = [CandlesFactory.get_candle(connector=kucoin,
           trading_pair="ETH-USDT", interval="1m", max_records=100)]
```

Following our [Technical Roadmap](https://blog.hummingbot.org/technical-roadmap-2023/), we are expanding our connectors to support to include all order types offered by an exchange. In this release, we integrated the `market_order` and `limit_maker_order` types for [Gate.io](/exchanges/gate-io).

!!! note
    In this release, we also improved test mocking for candles by ensuring that a coroutine related to filling historical candles is properly mocked.
