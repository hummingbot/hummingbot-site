## Config Management Refactoring

In [5428](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/5428), Hummingbot's configuration management system was significantly overhauled. The new approach uses `pydantic` models to define the configuration maps. Aside from built-in validation functionality, this approach also allows the automatic generation of JSON schemas which is a big first step in the direction of decoupling the bot from its interface. Another major step in that direction is significantly restricting the use of global variables when dealing with the global config map (now renamed to client config map) and the `AllConnectorSettings` class.

The approach to storing and retrieving secure configs has also been refactored. We no longer store secure configs in the client config map (former global config map). Those are only stored in the `Security` class (which is still unfortunately accessed globally). In addition, the secure values are no longer stored separate from non-secure configs — they are both part of the same config map and stored in the same `yaml` file.

When returning users log in to version 1.6.0, they will be prompted to enter their password to migrate their old configurations to the new configuration schema. If the configuration is successful, users will see the screen below"

!!! warning
    As this new version will automatically migrate any old configuration files due to the config management refactoring, we strongly advise users to create a backup of the config files first prior to updating the bots to 1.6.0. The migration process may also take some time or may encounter issues so it's advisable to implement the update at a more convenient period. Lastly, make sure to remove any existing scripts you have and download instead the latest helper scripts (`create.sh`, `update.sh`) from our installation [page](/installation/docker).

## New Gateway DEX Connector: UniswapLP

We are excited to re-introduce a connector for Uniswap that supports the Uniswap V3 AI, enabling users to add and remove concentrated liquidity ranges.

See the [Uniswap](/gateway/exchanges/uniswap/) documentation for more information.

## Restored Strategy: Uniswap-V3 LP

Because Gateway now supports the UniswapLP connector, we have restored the Uniswap V3 LP strategy that allows users to create a bot that adds concentrated liquidity ranges and dynamically adjusts them given flucutations in market price and volatility.

See the [`uniswap-lp-v3`](/strategies/uniswap-v3-lp) documentation for more information.

## New Gateway DEX Connector: Quickswap

[Quickswap](https://quickswap.exchange/) is the leading AMM DEX on the Polygon Network.
