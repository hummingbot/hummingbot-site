# Hummingbot v1.24.0 Release Notes

*Released on January 29, 2024*

## Introduction

As we step into a new year full of infinite possibilities, we are thrilled to present Hummingbot version 1.24.0! A major highlight of this version are **configurable scripts**, which lets users create config files for V2 Strategies and basic scripts just like they can for V1 Strategies. We also added more **sample V2 strategies**, including the new **DmanV4** advanced market making strategy.

This release also features substantial documentation updates, especially for exchange connector development and governance! Finally, we're excited to introduce two fresh DEX connectors: **Vega Protocol** and **QuipuSwap**, ensuring a broader range of trading opportunities for Hummingbot users across the DeFi landscape.

## Configurable Scripts

Ever since we introduced [Scripts](/scripts) as a lightweight way to create simple trading strategies, users have been asking for the ability to add configuration files for them, as they are able to do for V1 Strategies. Now, they finally can!

Starting in this release, scripts can define a `ScriptConfig` class that defines configuration parameters that users can store in a YAML file. Both V2 Scripts used to control V2 Strategies as well as more basic scripts can add this class with a few lines of code. Afterwards, users can create config files for scripts, which can be modified and shared easily.

See [Config Files](/client/config-files/#script-config-files) for details on how to use this feature.

## New Sample V2 Strategies

Hummingbot's new [V2 Strategies](/v2-strategies) allow users to create powerful custom strategies by configuring LEGO-like components as building blocks. In this release, we have added a page with a list of [Sample Strategies](/v2-strategies/examples/) that users can extend and modify.

In addition, we've also added a few new sample strategies:

### BollingerV1

A simple directional strategy that uses Bollinger Band Percent (BBP), which measures an asset's price relative to its upper and lower Bollinger Bands, to construct long/short signals.

### Trend Follower

A simple trend-following strategy that uses Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Bollinger Band Percent (BBP) to construct long/short signals.

**Pull Request:**  [#6741](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6741)

### DManV4

The new [**DManV4**](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/development/scripts/v2_dman_v4_multiple_pairs.py) strategy is a sophisticated market making strategy that utilizes Natural True Range (NATR) to dynamically set spreads, along with various advanced parameters for more nuanced controls.

## Connector Development and Governance Docs

This release features a revamped [Building Connectors](/developers/connectors/) section for developers building connectors to order book spot and perpetual exchanges. We've added pages tthat describe the latest spot and perpetual connector standards, developer and QA checklists, as well as debugging and troubleshooting docs.

In addition, we have also revised the [Polls](/governance/polls) section to reflect the changes approved in [HGP-50](https://snapshot.org/#/hbot.eth/proposal/0xc13f3b9fdaded22d1ce0b5528c9146fb2a762c41deed88e6c64e798465414738), which replaced the legacy Gold/Silver/Bronze maintenance tiers with a new system that allocate HBOT bounties among the connectors for each Poll based on their pro-rata voting share. Each connector may have a public HBOT maintenance bounty allocation which the Foundation will use to fund bounties for bug fixes and upgrades related to that exchange's Hummingbot connector that can be assigned to community developers.

## New DEX Connector: Vega Protocol

[Vega Protocol](https://vega.xyz/) is a new DEX built from the ground up using high performing, purpose-built smart contracts specifically for trading - meaning no fees on orders, and fairness at its core. It operates on the Vega Alpha Mainnet, a Tendermint based blockchain. For more information, see the [Vega](../exchanges/vega.md) connector docs.
