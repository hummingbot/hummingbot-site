## How to Install / Update

!!! warning "Configuration Changes in v2.11.0"
    This release includes schema changes to both Hummingbot and Gateway configuration files. **Existing configuration files are not compatible** and must be removed before updating. See [Updating to New Versions - Updates with Configuration Changes](../installation/update.md#updates-with-configuration-changes) for detailed instructions.

- **New Installation**: See the newly revamped [Installation](../installation/index.md) to get started with Hummingbot API with Condor, or the traditional Hummingbot Client.
- **Updating**: See [Updating to New Versions](../installation/update.md) for update instructions.

## Release Highlights

### 🚀 Simplified Installation & Deployment

This release brings major improvements to the installation experience across multiple repositories, making it easier than ever to get started with Hummingbot.

#### Hummingbot API: One-Line Cloud Deployment

The [Hummingbot API](../installation/hummingbot-api.md) installation has been streamlined with a one-line install command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hummingbot/deploy/main/setup.sh | bash -s -- --api
```

This single command clones the repository, prompts for credentials, and starts all services automatically. See the [Hummingbot API Quickstart](../installation/hummingbot-api.md) for full instructions.

#### Hummingbot Client: Refactored Makefile Commands

The [Hummingbot Client](../installation/hummingbot-client.md) installation has been reorganized with cleaner Makefile commands ([#7888](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7888)):

| Method | Step 1 | Step 2 | Step 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Docker (Recommended)** | `make setup` | `make deploy` | `docker attach hummingbot` |
| **Source** | `make install` | `make run` | - |

* **Improved Conda Integration:** `make install` now correctly creates and updates the conda environment.
* **Backward Compatible:** Previous `./start` command arguments still work with `make run`, e.g., `make run -p -f strategy.yml -c config.yml`

See the [Hummingbot Client Quickstart](../installation/hummingbot-client.md) for full instructions.


### 📊 Dynamic Order Book Initialization

**[#7930](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7930)** - This is a major performance improvement contributed by [@cardosofede](https://github.com/cardosofede).

<iframe style="width:100%; min-height:400px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IvwlJ1ebKzk?si=w6f1e39J9wWzrnQR" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Hummingbot now supports dynamic order book initialization, a performance optimization that allows order books to be loaded on-demand rather than all at startup. This feature is particularly beneficial for traders running strategies across multiple exchanges or managing large numbers of trading pairs.

Previously, Hummingbot would initialize order books for all configured trading pairs when the bot started, which could lead to longer startup times and higher memory usage. With this update, order books are now initialized dynamically when they're actually needed.

**Highlights**

- On-Demand Loading: Order books are initialized only when a trading pair is actively used, reducing startup time significantly.

- Lower Memory Footprint: Memory is allocated only for trading pairs currently in use, enabling more efficient resource utilization.

- Runtime Flexibility: Strategies can dynamically add or remove trading pairs without requiring a bot restart.

- Multi-Exchange Support: Implemented for Binance Spot, Binance Perpetual, and Gate.io connectors.

### 📈 Hyperliquid HIP-3 Markets Support

**[#7952](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7952)** - Simplified HIP-3 configuration by enabling it by default, contributed by [@isreallee82](https://github.com/isreallee82).

Hummingbot now fully supports HIP-3 (DEX) markets on the Hyperliquid Perpetual connector, enabling traders to access a broader range of trading pairs including permissionlessly listed tokens on Hyperliquid's decentralized spot exchange.

**Highlights**

- Full HIP-3 Integration: Trade on permissionless DEX markets with support for the unique HIP-3 trading pair format, including both uppercase and lowercase prefixes.

- Enabled by Default: HIP-3 markets are now always enabled in the connector ([#7952](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7952)), removing the need for manual configuration. The `enable_hip3_markets` config option has been removed entirely.

- Candles & Order Book Support: Complete data feed integration including candlestick data and real-time order book updates for HIP-3 markets.

- Rate Source Integration: Added hyperliquid_perpetual as a rate source mode for accurate mid-price calculations.

This update expands Hummingbot's capabilities on Hyperliquid, allowing traders to run automated strategies across the full spectrum of available markets.

### 🔑 Gateway Wallet Management API

Gateway now includes comprehensive wallet management capabilities, enabling programmatic wallet creation, private key retrieval, and token transfers directly through the API. This feature supports both Solana and Ethereum chains with a security-first design.

**New API Endpoints**

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `POST /wallet/create` | Create a new wallet server-side, stored encrypted in Gateway |
| `POST /wallet/show-private-key` | Retrieve the private key for a wallet (requires passphrase) |
| `POST /wallet/send` | Send native tokens (SOL/ETH) or SPL/ERC20 tokens |

**Programmatic Wallet Creation**: Generate new wallets via API without manual key management, perfect for automated trading infrastructure.

**Secure Key Storage**: All wallets are encrypted using Gateway's passphrase before storage.

**Multi-Chain Support**: Works seamlessly with both Solana and Ethereum ecosystems.

**Local Generation Option**: Includes a CLI script (pnpm wallet:create) for generating keypairs locally before adding to Gateway.
