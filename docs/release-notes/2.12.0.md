!!! note
    Other Hummingbot repositories such as [Hummingbot-API](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot-api), [Hummingbot MCP](https://github.com/hummingbot/mcp), [Quants-Lab](https://github.com/hummingbot/quant-lab), and [Condor](https://github.com/hummingbot/condor) follow a continuous deployment model without fixed version releases. Use the `main` branch for these repositories.

## How to Install / Update

- **New Installation**: See the newly revamped [Installation](../installation/index.md) to get started with Hummingbot API with Condor, or the traditional Hummingbot Client.
- **Updating**: See [Updating to New Versions](../installation/update.md) for update instructions.

## Release Highlights

### 🚀 Simplified Installation & Deployment

This release brings major improvements to the installation experience across multiple repositories, making it easier than ever to get started with Hummingbot.

#### Hummingbot API + Condor

The [Hummingbot API and Condor](../installation/hummingbot-api.md) installation process has been streamlined with a one-line install command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hummingbot/deploy/main/setup.sh | bash -s
```

This single command clones both repositories, prompts for credentials, and starts all services automatically. See the [Hummingbot API Quickstart](../installation/hummingbot-api.md) for full installation walkthrough.

#### Hummingbot Client

The [Hummingbot Client](../installation/hummingbot-client.md) installation has been reorganized with cleaner Makefile commands ([#7888](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7888)):

* **Improved Conda Integration:** `make install` now correctly creates and updates the conda environment.
* **Backward Compatible:** Previous `./start` command arguments still work with `make run`, e.g., `make run -p -f strategy.yml -c config.yml`

See the [Hummingbot Client Quickstart](../installation/hummingbot-client.md) for full instructions.


### 📊 Dynamic Order Book Initialization

Hummingbot now supports dynamic order book initialization, a performance optimization that allows order books to be loaded on-demand rather than all at startup. This feature is particularly beneficial for traders running strategies across multiple exchanges or managing large numbers of trading pairs.

Previously, Hummingbot would initialize order books for all configured trading pairs when the bot started, which could lead to longer startup times and higher memory usage. With this update, order books are now initialized dynamically when they're actually needed.

**Highlights**

- On-Demand Loading: Order books are initialized only when a trading pair is actively used, reducing startup time significantly.

- Lower Memory Footprint: Memory is allocated only for trading pairs currently in use, enabling more efficient resource utilization.

- Runtime Flexibility: Strategies can dynamically add or remove trading pairs without requiring a bot restart.

Try it out with the [dynamic_orderbook_demo.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/dynamic_orderbook_demo.py) script.

### 📈 Hyperliquid HIP-3 Markets Support

Hummingbot now fully supports HIP-3 (DEX) markets on the Hyperliquid Perpetual connector, enabling traders to access a broader range of trading pairs including permissionlessly listed tokens on Hyperliquid's decentralized spot exchange.

**Highlights**

- Full HIP-3 Integration: Trade on permissionless DEX markets with support for the unique HIP-3 trading pair format, including both uppercase and lowercase prefixes.

- Candles & Order Book Support: Complete data feed integration including candlestick data and real-time order book updates for HIP-3 markets.

- Rate Source Integration: Added hyperliquid_perpetual as a rate source mode for accurate mid-price calculations.

### 🛠️ Hummingbot API Enhancements

**New Services Architecture**

- **UnifiedConnectorService**: Single source of truth for all connector instances, managing both trading connectors (authenticated, per-account) and data connectors (shared, for public market data)
- **MarketDataService**: Centralized market data access (candles, order books, prices) with automatic feed lifecycle management
- **TradingService**: Centralized trading operations with AccountTradingInterface - a ScriptStrategyBase-compatible interface that executors can use
- **ExecutorService**: Manages Hummingbot executors directly via API without Docker containers or full strategy setup

**New API Endpoints**

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/executors` | Full CRUD for executor management (Position, Grid, DCA, TWAP, Arbitrage, XEMM, Order executors) |
| `/rate-oracle` | Rate oracle configuration and rate queries |

**New Features**

- **Position Hold Tracking**: Aggregates positions from executors stopped with `keep_position=true`, tracking buy/sell amounts, breakeven prices, and realized/unrealized PnL
- **Order Book Tracker Registration**: Proper management of order book trackers per trading pair with automatic cleanup
- **Executor Persistence**: Database storage of executor state and history

### 🔑 Gateway Wallet Management API

Gateway now includes comprehensive wallet management capabilities, enabling programmatic wallet creation, private key retrieval, and token transfers directly through the API. This feature supports both Solana and Ethereum chains with a security-first design.

**New API Endpoints**

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `POST /wallet/create` | Create a new wallet server-side, stored encrypted in Gateway |
| `POST /wallet/show-private-key` | Retrieve the private key for a wallet (requires passphrase) |
| `POST /wallet/send` | Send native tokens (SOL/ETH) or SPL/ERC20 tokens |

**Programmatic Wallet Creation**: Generate new wallets via API without manual key management, perfect for automated trading infrastructure.

**Secure Key Storage**: All wallets are encrypted using Gateway's passphrase before storage.

**Local Generation Option**: Includes a CLI script (pnpm wallet:create) for generating keypairs locally before adding to Gateway.
