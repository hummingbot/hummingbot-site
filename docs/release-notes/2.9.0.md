!!! note
    Other Hummingbot repositories such as [Dashboard](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard), [Hummingbot-API](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot-api), [Hummingbot API Client](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot-api-client), [Quants-Lab](https://github.com/hummingbot/quant-lab), [Deploy](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy) and [Hummingbot MCP](https://github.com/hummingbot/mcp) follow a continuous deployment model without fixed version releases. Use the `main` branch for these repositories.

## How to Update

### Docker

Re-run the [Deploy](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy) setup script:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy.git
cd deploy
bash setup.sh
```

For individual images, exit running containers, pull the latest images, and restart:
```bash
docker compose down
docker pull hummingbot/hummingbot:latest
docker compose up -d
```

### Source

Update the branches of each repo to this release by running:
```bash
git pull origin master # Hummingbot
git pull origin main # Gateway
```

Afterwards, follow the instructions to re-install dependencies and compile the codebase for each repository. See [Install Hummingbot from Source](/installation/linux/) and [Install Gateway from Source](/gateway/installation).

## Release Highlights

### ‚ú® Updated Quants Lab for R&D

We've completely overhauled the **hummingbot/quants-lab** repository, transforming it into a comprehensive platform for quantitative trading research. This refactor includes a reorganized codebase, a new task scheduling system, Telegram/Discord/email notifications, and example Jupyter notebooks for data collection, screeners, notifiers, and other tasks.

**Key Updates**

* **Data Collection & Processing:** Collect and process market data from multiple sources for systematic analysis.
* **Strategy Development:** Build custom screeners, develop trading strategies, and backtest them using the Hummingbot Python library.
* **Task Orchestration:** Automate scheduled execution of Jupyter notebooks and custom tasks.
* **Notifications:** Schedule automated reports via email, Telegram, Slack, and Discord.
* **Quick Start:** New Jupyter notebooks in `research_notebooks/` to help you get started faster.


See the [Quants Lab Documentation](/quants-lab/) for detailed information and installation guide.

### ü•û PancakeSwap Connector

We have refactored and restored the [PancakeSwap](/exchanges/gateway/pancakeswap) connector to Gateway, enabling trading and liquidity provision using the modernized Gateway architecture on the largest DEX on BNB Chain and other EVM networks.

**Supported Features**

* **Smart Router:** Optimal trade execution across V2 and V3 pools
* **V2 AMM Pools:** Classic constant product pools with liquidity provision
* **V3 CLMM Pools:** Concentrated liquidity positions with custom price ranges
* **Multi-Chain Support:** BNB Chain, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, and zkSync

This connector was built by **[vic-en](https://github.com/vic-en)** as part of a HBOT bounty. **Thanks @vic-en for this contribution! üôè**

### üöÄ RPC Provider Abstraction System

After [#506](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/pull/506) and [#508](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/pull/508), Gateway now features a flexible RPC provider abstraction system that significantly improves blockchain connectivity and performance for DEX trading. This system allows you to easily switch between standard RPC endpoints and specialized providers optimized for specific networks, ensuring low latency, high availability, and accurate blockchain data.

**Key Features**

* **Helius Integration:** Leading Solana validator integration with optimized batching, optional WebSocket RPC, regional endpoints for lowest latency, and Jito support.
* **Infura Integration:** Enhanced reliability across Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Avalanche, BSC, Celo, and Sepolia with automatic endpoint resolution and optional WebSocket connections.
* **RPC Provider Namespace:** Use `gateway config <provider> update` commands to add API keys.
* **Extensible Architecture:** Easily add custom RPC providers through a standardized service interface.

See the [RPC Provider Configuration Guide](/gateway/rpc) for detailed setup instructions and supported networks.

### üèóÔ∏è Connector Architecture Improvements

In [#7742](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7742), we've completed a major architectural refactor to decouple exchange connectors from the global configuration system, making them more modular and easier to use across different Hummingbot components and external applications.

**Key Improvements**

* **Simplified Integration:** Connectors can now be initialized and used independently without requiring the full Hummingbot configuration system.
* **Enhanced Modularity:** Rate limits, balance limits, and metrics collection are now passed as configurable parameters rather than pulled from global config.
* **Better Extensibility:** The refactor makes it easier to use Hummingbot connectors in external tools like the [Hummingbot API](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot-api) and [Quants Lab](https://github.com/hummingbot/quants-lab).
* **Cleaner Architecture:** Reduced tight coupling between trading core and configuration management for improved maintainability.

This change is primarily architectural and doesn't affect the user experience in the main Hummingbot client, but significantly improves developer experience when building with Hummingbot components.
