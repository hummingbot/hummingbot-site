## Release Highlights

#### ‚ú® Quants-lab Refactor: New Features

We've completely overhauled the **hummingbot/quants-lab** repository to improve user experience and functionality. Key improvements include a reorganized codebase, a new task scheduling system with cron support, and a REST API for triggering tasks. We've also introduced notifiers for email, Telegram, Slack, and Discord.

**Key Updates**

* **Task Orchestration:** Schedule Jupyter notebooks directly with new `on_success` and `on_failure` methods.
* **Notifications:** Get updates via email, Telegram, Slack, and Discord.
* **Simplified Data:** We've replaced TimescaleDB with Parquet files for easier data management.
* **Quick Start:** New configuration templates are available to help you get started faster.
