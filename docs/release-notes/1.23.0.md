## R&D: First steps toward a Hummingbot AI assistant

<iframe style="width:100%; min-height:400px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JZfACS1v9H8?si=KQ2sbU-h39Jf-hfE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The **Hummingbot Helper** repository is designed to explore, test, and refine the use of **Large Language Models** (LLMs) in enhancing the functionality and user experience of Hummingbot. We believe that these new technologies may synergize well with Hummingbot's trading engine, strategy frameworks, and connectors system.

Initially, we have set up a few research Jupyter notebooks to developing preprocessing techniques and effective LLM chains to assist users in running bots and efficiently answering questions related to Hummingbot's documentation.

## New Script: Crypto Volatility Screener

The new [**Volatility Screener**](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/screener_volatility.py) sample script provides an new way to use Hummingbot: It conducts a detailed analysis of market volatility for multiple cryptocurrency pairs on a specified exchange, utilizing various metrics and indicators like percentage changes, Bollinger Bands, and standard deviation calculations. 

The script is designed to provide periodic reports, making it a useful tool for traders looking to understand and capitalize on market volatility.

## New DEX Connector: Hyperliquid

[Hyperliquid](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/), launched in 2023, is at the forefront of decentralized perpetual exchanges, recognized for its exceptional speed and liquidity. Operating on a unique Layer 1 blockchain, Hyperliquid is transforming the DeFi landscape with a user-centric design and advanced trading features. A key highlight is the introduction of **Vaults**, a novel concept designed to streamline asset management and bolster trading efficiency. These Vaults offer a secure and effective solution for asset storage while facilitating sophisticated trading strategies.

For more information, see [Hyperliquid](../exchanges/hyperliquid.md) in our exchange connector documentation.

## New Chain and DEX Connector: XRP Ledger

Launched in 2012, [Ripple](https://ripple.com/xrp/) is a prominent player in the digital payment protocol and cryptocurrency space, primarily known for its digital payment network and protocol. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, Ripple operates on a decentralized open-source protocol and supports token issuance of various kinds, including its native cryptocurrency, XRP. Ripple's technology allows for fast, low-cost international transactions, making it a favored choice for cross-border settlements. The platform's unique consensus mechanism distinguishes it from other blockchain-based systems, offering enhanced scalability and efficiency. Ripple's ecosystem includes a wide range of financial institutions and payment networks.

See [DEX Connectors - XRP Ledger](../exchanges/xrpl.md) and [Chain Connectors - XRP Ledger](../chains/xrpl.md) for the respective DEX and chain documentation pages.
