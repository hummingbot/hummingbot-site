HBOT holders can vote on four types of proposals:

* [**Pull Request Proposal (PRP)**](#pull-request-proposals): To merge a non-Connector pull request into the Hummingbot codebase
* [**New Connector Proposal (NCP)**](#new-connector-proposals): To add a new [Connector](../exchanges/index.md) to the Hummingbot codebase
* [**Hummingbot Improvement Proposal (HIP)**](#hummingbot-improvement-proposals): To propose a [Bounty](../bounties/index.md)
* [**Hummingbot Governance Proposal (HGP)**](#hummingbot-governance-proposals): To conduct [Polls](polls.md), elect Board of Directors, and implement other governance system changes

Each proposal type has different parameters:

!!! tip
    You can see all proposals from the main [hbot.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/hbot.eth) Snapshot space.

!!! note
    See the [HBOT Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UNAumPMnXfsghAAXrfKkPGRH9QlC8k7Cu1FGQVL1t0M/edit?usp=sharing) for the current Quorum Percentage, which is based on the HBOT circulating supply.

## Types of Proposals

### Pull Request Proposals

* Pull Request Proposals (PRP) let HBOT holders **approve pull requests** for merge and inclusion into the Hummingbot codebase.
* Any wallet with a HBOT balance that meets Minimum HBOT Balance with can create a PRP at the Snapshot sub-space: <https://snapshot.org/#/hbot-prp.eth>.
* A PRP links to a valid pull request in the Hummingbot code repository. See [Contribution Guidelines](../developers/contributions.md) for more information about the process of creating a valid pull request.
* If the PRP is approved after the Vote Duration and the Quorum is met, then the Foundation will begin the process of reviewing and merging the pull request into the codebase.
* During the review process, the Foundation will test the submitted pull request to ensure that it fulfills its stated intention, conduct a technical code review, check for conflicts with other parts of the Hummingbot codebase and security issues. If the review passes, the pull request is merged into the codebase.
* If the PRP fails to meet the Approval Threshold, the Foundation will close the related pull request. However, the developer is free to create a new pull request and a new PRP at a subsequent date.

To be considered valid, a PRP should contain the following fields (otherwise the Foundation may close it):

* **Title**: Starts with `PRP` followed by count and summary (i.e. `PRP-100: [summary]`)
* **Github Link**: Link to a [Github pull request](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pulls), which should contain a detailed explanation of the changes proposed

### New Connector Proposals

* New Connector Proposals (NCP) let HBOT holders **approve new connectors** for merge and inclusion into the Hummingbot codebase.
* [Connectors](../exchanges/index.md) are integrations to centralized exchanges (CEX), decentralized exchanges (DEX), and L1/L2 blockchain networks
* Since reviewing, merging, and maintaining connectors requires more effort than normal pull requests, this proposal type 
* Any wallet with a HBOT balance that meets Minimum HBOT Balance with can create a NCP at the Snapshot sub-space: <https://snapshot.org/#/hbot-ncp.eth>.
* Similar to PRPs, the proposal should include a link to a valid pull request in the Hummingbot code repository. See [Contribution Guideline](../developers/contributions.md) for more information about the process of creating a valid pull request.
* If the NCP is approved after the Vote Duration and the Quorum is met, then the Foundation will begin the process of reviewing and merging the pull request into the codebase.
* During the review process, the Foundation will test the submitted pull request to ensure that it fulfills its stated intention, conduct a technical code review, check for conflicts with other parts of the Hummingbot codebase and security issues. If the review passes, the pull request is merged into the codebase.
* If the NCP fails to meet the Approval Threshold, the Foundation will close the related pull request. However, the developer is free to create a new pull request and a new NCP at a subsequent date.
To be considered valid, a NCP should contain the following fields (otherwise the Foundation may close it):

* **Title**: Starts with `NCP` followed by count and summary (i.e. `NCP-100: [summary]`)
* **Github Link**: Link to a [Github pull request](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pulls) that contain the connector code along with sufficient unit test coverage

### Hummingbot Improvement Proposals

* Hummingbot Improvement Proposals (HIP) let HBOT holders propose [Bounties](../bounties/index.md) for improvements to the Hummingbot codebase, content that educates the user base, and/or other programs that benefit the Hummingbot community.
* HIPs may name a specific developer, in which case the bounty is assigned to the developer if it is approved. If not, the Foundation will mark the bounty as Open and publicize it to the community.
* Any wallet with a HBOT balance that meets Minimum HBOT Balance with can create a HIP at the Snapshot sub-space: <https://snapshot.org/#/hbot-hip.eth>
* Before creating an HIP, we recommend creating a thread in [Discord](https://discord.gg/hummingbot) under the **#proposals** channel to gauge whether the requested HBOT amount is appropriate.
* If the HIP is approved after the Vote Duration and the Quorum Percentage is met, then the Foundation will create a [Bounty](../bounties/index.md) and follow the assignation process.

To be considered valid, a HIP should contain the following fields (otherwise the Foundation may close it):

* **Title**: Starts with `HIP` followed by count and summary (i.e. `HIP-100: [summary]`)
* **Github Link**: Link to a Github [issue](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pulls)
* **HBOT Allocation**: Proposed HBOT bounty amount
* **Developer** (if assigned): Link to a developer's Github page or website

### Hummingbot Governance Proposals

* Hummingbot Governance Proposals (HGP) are generally used by the Foundation to **conduct regular polls** that allow HBOT holders to decide which [Connectors](../exchanges/index.md)) should be retained and prioritized in future Hummingbot releases.
* The Foundation also uses HGP to elects its [Board of Directors](/about/#board-of-directors) every year.
* HGPs can also be used to propose changes to the Foundation governance system
* Any wallet with a HBOT balance that meets Minimum HBOT Balance with can create a HGP at the main Snapshot space: <https://snapshot.org/#/hbot.eth>.
* Before creating an HGP, we recommend creating a thread in [Discord](https://discord.gg/hummingbot) under the **#proposals** channel to gauge whether the requested HBOT amount is appropriate.

To be considered valid, an HGP should contain the following fields:

* **Title**: Starts with `HGP` followed by count and summary (i.e. `HGP-100: [summary]`)
* **Description**: Detailed explanation of the proposed initiative or program
* **HBOT Allocation** (if any): Proposed HBOT bounty amount
