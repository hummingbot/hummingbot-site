The Hummingbot Foundation is an experiment in creating a self-sustainable open source ecosystem. [Distribution](/hbot/#community-distributions) of the remaining HBOT community reserves (36 million tokens or 36% of total HBOT supply) to the Hummingbot user base over the next 4 years is an important aspect of preserving Foundation self-sustainability. Therefore, the Foundation plans to iterate and improve on this distribution process via **Epochs**. 

Each Epoch is a fixed, 5-month period with specific HBOT distribution-related goals across various categories. Epochs are basically long agile sprints, after which the Foundation will conduct an open retrospective and strengthen internal processes for the next Epoch.

## Epoch 1

- **Start**: Feb 1, 2022
- **End**: June 30, 2022
- **Goal**: Distribute 30 million HBOT tokens

| Category                                                                      | Total HBOT Available      | Target Number of Grants |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| [Liquidity Distributions](/governance/proposals/hgp/#liquidity-distributions-ld) | 15,000,000                | 10 platforms             |
| [Dev Grant Budget](/governance/proposals/hgp/#dev-grant-budget-dg)               | 10,000,000                | 50 dev grants           |
| [Initiative Budget](/governance/proposals/hgp/#initiative-budget-ib)     | 5,000,000                 | 5 initiatives           |

### HBOT Guidance

In requesting HBOT grants for Hummingbot Improvement Proposals (HIPs) related to a community-approved [Dev Grant Budget](/governance/proposals/hgp/#dev-grant-budget-dg), developers may need guidance in determining how much HBOT to request for unit of time/effort spent on a given task.

For Epoch 1, the Hummingbot Foundation believes that **20,000 HBOT for one day of work** is a reasonable amount for an experienced developer to request for a valid HIP. However, developers are free to request more or less than this amount in their proposal.

## Epoch 2

- **Start**: August 1, 2022
- **End**: December 31, 2022
- **Goal**: Distribute 60 million HBOT tokens

We plan to conduct an open retrospective and strengthen Foundation processes after Epoch 1 before finalizing goals for Epoch 2.
