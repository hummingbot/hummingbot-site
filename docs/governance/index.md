Hummingbot Foundation's purpose is to empower Hummingbot Governance Token (HBOT) token holders to govern how the Hummingbot open source codebase evolves over time. HBOT holders can vote on Proposals and Polls that:

* Approve pull requests to the Hummingbot codebase
* Decide which connectors of various types should be included in the codebase
* Allocate HBOT bounty budget toward the top connectors of each type 
* Re-elect the foundation's Board of Directors each year

Pages in this section include:

* [Polls](polls.md): Polls that let HBOT holders determine which connectors are included for the next Epoch
* [Proposals](proposals.md): Proposals are used to add new connectors and allocate HBOT bounties
* [Epochs](epochs.md): Quarterly periods of codebase maintenance defined via Polls
* [Whitepaper](whitepaper.md): Published in December 2021, this document explains the Foundation's principles and organizational structure
