## Overview

In 2019, Hummingbot was introduced as a command-line based market-making bot.

With the 2024 release of Hummingbot 2.0, we are excited to introduce [Hummingbot Dashboard](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard), an open-source graphical interface designed to help users manage their portfolios across multiple exchanges, configure and backtest strategies, and deploy and manage multiple Hummingbot instances efficiently. 

Not only does Dashboard simplify the process of managing bots at scale, but it also is designed to be compatible with [Controllers](../v2-strategies/controllers/index.md), which users can use Dashboard to configure and backtest before deploying live.

## Highlights

* **Accessible Framework**: Uses the [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) open source data visualization framework
* **Backtestable Strategies**: Configure and [backtest](./backtest.md) strategy controllers
* **Multi-Bot Deployment**: [Deploy](./deploy.md) and [manage](./instances.md) multiple bot instances and monitor their real-time performance
