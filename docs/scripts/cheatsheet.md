See below for reference docs that help you create Scripts that inherit from the [`ScriptStrategy`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/strategy/script_strategy_base.py) base class.

This Script Strategies Cheatsheet is also available in [PDF form](./cheatsheet.pdf).

## Getting started

- Follow the [Installation](/installation) docs for your environment
- Code your script inside the [/scripts](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/tree/master/scripts) folder
- Run your script with `start --script [SCRIPT NAME]`

## Scripts basics

### Configuration

Scripts are a subclass of [`ScriptStrategy`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/strategy/script_strategy_base.py).

You can define the variables that you will use as class variables. By default, there is no configuration file for scripts.

### Markets

Define the connectors and trading pairs, in the class variable markets, with the following structure:

```python
Dict["connector_name", Set(Trading pairs)]
```

### Execution

- The method `on_tick` is executed every `tick_size`
- The `tick_size` by default is 1 second

## Market Operations

### Create and cancel Orders

```python
self.buy(connector_name, trading_pair, amount, order_type, price, [position_action])
self.sell(connector_name, trading_pair, amount, order_type, price,[position_action])
self.cancel(connector_name, trading_pair, order_id)```
# position_action is only used in perpetual connectors
```

## Account Data

### Balance

`self.get_balance_df()`

* Returns a DataFrame with the following columns: `["Exchange", "Asset", "Total Balance", "Available Balance"]`

### Open Orders

`self.active_orders_df()`

* Returns a DataFrame with the following columns: `["Exchange", "Market", "Side", "Price", "Amount", "Age"]`

## Events

You can create custom handlers for various market events by implementing one or more of the following methods in your script:

```python
did_create_buy_order(self, event: BuyOrderCreatedEvent)
did_create_sell_order(self, event: SellOrderCreatedEvent)
did_fill_order(self, event: OrderFilledEvent)
did_fail_order(self, event: MarketOrderFailureEvent)
did_cancel_order(self, event: OrderCancelledEvent)
did_expire_order(self, event: OrderExpiredEvent)
did_complete_buy_order(self, event: BuyOrderCompletedEvent)
did_complete_sell_order(self, event: SellOrderCompletedEvent)
```


## Other

### Rate Oracle

- Provides conversion rates for any given pair token symbols in both async and sync fashions
- Sync Method: `RateOracle.get_instance().get_pair_rate(trading_pair)`
- Async Method: `RateOracle.get_instance().rate_async(trading_pair)`

### Notifiers

To send notifications to the Hummingbot client, use the following methods:

```python
self.notify_hb_app(msg)
self.notify_hb_app_with_timestamp(msg)
```

!!! tip
    If you have the [Telegram integration](/global-configs/telegram/) activated, you will receive the notifications there too.

### Status

- When you run the `status` command in the app, you will receive the information that is coded under the method `format_status`
- You can override this method in your script to show any information that you want. Check out [Quickstart - Exercise 3](../getting-started/custom-script/custom-pmm-3.md) for an example.
- By default, the format status shows the balances and active orders. Check the implementation in [`ScriptStrategy`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/strategy/script_strategy_base.py).

## Connectors

### Accessing the Connectors

A connection is stored in the instance variable `connectors` with the following structure: `Dict["connector_name", ConnectorBase]`

For example, `self.connectors["binance"]` will return the Binance exchange class.

### Connectors Methods

- Best ask: `connector.get_price(trading_pair, is_buy=True)`
- Best bid: `connector.get_price(trading_pair, is_buy=False)`
- Mid-price: `connector.get_mid_price(trading_pair)`
- Order book: `connector.get_order_book(trading_pair)`. Returns a `CompositeOrderBook` object, whose most common methods are:
    - `ask_entries()` --> Iterator of `OrderBookRow`
    - `bid_entries()` --> Iterator of `OrderBookRow`
    - `snapshot()` --> Tuple(Bids as DataFrame, Asks as DataFrame)

For example, `self.connectors["binance"].get_mid_price("ETH-USDT")` will return the mid price for the ETH-USDT trading pair on Binance.

### Querying the Order Book

Use these methods to compute metrics efficiently:

```python
connector.get_vwap_for_volume(trading_pair, is_buy, volume)
connector.get_price_for_volume(trading_pair, is_buy, volume)
connector.get_quote_volume_for_base_amount(trading_pair, is_buy, base_amount)
connector.get_volume_for_price(trading_pair, is_buy, price)
connector.get_quote_volume_for_price(trading_pair, is_buy,price)
```

Returns a `ClientOrderBookQueryResult` class with:

- `query_price`
- `query_volume`
- `result_price`
- `result_volume`

## Accounting

### Order Candidate

- `OrderCandidate(trading_pair, is_maker, order_type, order_side, amount, price)`
- Has methods to populate the object with the collateral needed, the fees, and potential returns

### Budget Checker

This checks if the balance is enough to place the order, `all_or_none=True` will set the amount to 0 on insufficient balance and `all_or_none=False` will adjust the order size to the available balance.

```python
connector.budget_checker.adjust_candidate(OrderCandidate, all_or_none=True)
connector.budget_checker.adjust_candidates(List[OrderCandidate], all_or_none=True)
```
