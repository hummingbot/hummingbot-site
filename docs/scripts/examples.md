## How to Run Scripts

In the Hummingbot client, run a script with:

```
start --script [SCRIPT NAME]
```

Scripts can be created both with and without [config files](/client/config-files/). To create a configuration file for your script, execute:

```shell
create --script-config [SCRIPT_FILE]
```

This command auto-completes with scripts from the local `/scripts` directory that are configurable. You'll be prompted to specify strategy parameters, which are then saved in a YAML file within the `conf/scripts` directory. To run the script, use:

```shell
start --script [SCRIPT_FILE] --conf [SCRIPT_CONFIG_FILE]
```

## Starting Scripts

All sample scripts below can be found in the root [/scripts](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/tree/development/scripts) folder and are available to run from the Hummingbot client by default.

### Simple PMM

* **Code:** [simple_pmm](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/development/scripts/simple_pmm.py)

* **Release Added**: Configurable [1.25.0](../release-notes/1.9.0.md) | [1.9.0](../release-notes/1.9.0.md)
* **Description**: The bot will place two orders around the `price_source` (mid price or last traded price) in a `trading_pair` on exchange, with a distance defined by the `ask_spread` and `bid_spread`. Every `order_refresh_time` in seconds, the bot will cancel and replace the orders.

* **Release Added**: [1.7.0](../release-notes/1.7.0.md)
* **Description**: This example lets you create one VWAP in a market using a percentage of the sum volume of the order book until a spread from the mid price. This example demonstrates:
      - How to get the account balance
      - How to get the bids and asks of a market
      - How to code a "utility" strategy

* **Description**:  A simplified version of the [Cross Exchange Market Making](/strategies/cross-exchange-market-making/) strategy, this bot makes a market on the maker pair and hedges any filled trades in the taker pair. If the spread (difference between maker order price and taker hedge price) dips below `min_spread`, the bot refreshes the order

* **Description**: Demonstrates using `AmmGatewayDataFeed` in Hummingbot to fetch real-time price data from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap (Ethereum), Jupiter (Solana), and Hydration (Polkadot). The script initializes two AMM data feeds for specified trading pairs and displays their latest price data when ready.

### AMM Price
* **Code**: [amm_price_example](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/development/scripts/amm_price_example.py)

* **Description**: Demonstrates fetching real-time quotes using the `GatewaySwap` connector within Hummingbot for decentralized exchanges (DEXs). The script retrieves swap prices for specified trading pairs, allowing users to easily integrate accurate pricing data from protocols like Jupiter on Solana or Hydration on Polkadot.

### AMM Trade
* **Code**: [amm_trade_example](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/development/scripts/amm_price_example.py)
* **Author**: [fengtality](https://github.com/fengtality)
* **Release Added**: [2.5.0](../release-notes/2.5.0.md)
* **Description**: Monitors real-time DEX prices using the `GatewaySwap` connector and automatically executes swaps once specified price thresholds are reached. The script allows users to configure conditions (price above or below a target) and handles trade execution seamlessly on decentralized exchanges like Jupiter on Solana,  Uniswap on Ethereum or Hydration on Polkadot.

### CLMM Position Manager
* **Code**: [clmm_manage_position](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/development/scripts/clmm_manage_position.py)
* **Author**: [fengtality](https://github.com/fengtality)
* **Release Added**: [2.5.0](../release-notes/2.5.0.md)
* **Description**: Actively monitors prices on a Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker (CLMM) pool via Gateway, opening a liquidity position when a specified target price is reached. The script manages the position dynamically, automatically closing it if the market moves outside the defined range for a certain duration, ensuring efficient liquidity management on pools like Meteora or Raydium on Solana.


### Download Order Book and Trades
* **Code**: [download_order_book_and_trades](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/development/scripts/download_order_book_and_trades.py)

The script logs and reports its operations and the status of active arbitrage positions.

### V2 TWAP

* **Code**: [v2_twap_multiple_pairs.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/development/scripts/v2_twap_multiple_pairs.py)

## Other Scripts

Other example scripts can be found in sub-folders in the [scripts folder](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/tree/development/scripts):

* Basic: Scripts that peform basic operations (good for beginner script developers)
* Community: Strategies created by Botcamp participants
* Gateway: Scripts that utilize [Gateway](/gateway)
* Utility: Scripts that fetch data, screen markets, and perform other functions

To make a script available to run inside Hummingbot, copy or move the file into the root `/scripts` folder. For example:

```bash
cp scripts/basic/format_status_example.py scripts
```
